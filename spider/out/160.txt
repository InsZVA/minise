A Funeral Elegy for Master William Peter




TO MASTER JOHN PETER
of Bowhay in Devon, Esquire.



W. S.


A FUNERAL ELEGY.





Since time, and his predestinated end,


Abridged the circuit of his hopeful days,


Whiles both his youth and virtue did intend


The good endeavors of deserving praise,

5
What memorable monument can last

Whereon to build his never-blemished name

But his own worth, wherein his life was graced. . .

Sith as that ever he maintained the same?

Oblivion in the darkest day to come,

10
When sin shall tread on merit in the dust,

Cannot rase out the lamentable tomb

Of his short-lived deserts; but still they must,

Even in the hearts and memories of men,

Claim fit respect, that they, in every limb

15
Remembering what he was, with comfort then

May pattern out one truly good, by him.

For he was truly good, if honest care

Of harmless conversation may commend

A life free from such stains as follies are,

20
Ill recompensed only in his end.

Nor can the tongue of him who loved him least

(If there can be minority of love

To one superlative above the rest

Of many men in steady faith) reprove

25
His constant temper, in the equal weight

Of thankfulness and kindness: Truth doth leave

Sufficient proof, he was in every right

As kind to give, as thankful to receive.

The curious eye of a quick-brained survey

30
Could scantly find a mote amidst the sun

Of his too-shortened days, or make a prey

Of any faulty errors he had done.

Not that he was above the spleenful sense

And spite of malice, but for that he had

35
Warrant enough in his own innocence

Against the sting of some in nature bad.

Yet who is he so absolutely blest

That lives encompassed in a mortal frame,

Sometime in reputation not oppressed

40
By some in nothing famous but defame?

Such in the bypath and the ridgeway lurk

That leads to ruin, in a smooth pretense

Of what they do to be a special work

Of singleness, not tending to offense;

45
Whose very virtues are, not to detract

Whiles hope remains of gain (base fee of slaves),

Despising chiefly men in fortunes wracked.

But death to such gives unremembered graves.

Now therein lived he happy, if to be

50
Free from detraction happiness it be.

His younger years gave comfortable hope

To hope for comfort in his riper youth,

Which, harvest-like, did yield again the crop

Of education, bettered in his truth.

55
Those noble twins of heaven-infused races,

Learning and wit, refined in their kind

Did jointly both, in their peculiar graces,

Enrich the curious temple of his mind;

Indeed a temple, in whose precious white

60
Sat reason by religion overswayed,

Teaching his other senses, with delight,

How piety and zeal should be obeyed.

Not fruitlessly in prodigal expense

Wasting his best of time, but so content

65
With reason's golden mean to make defense

Against the assault of youth's encouragement;

As not the tide of this surrounding age

(When now his father's death had freed his will)

Could make him subject to the drunken rage

70
Of such whose only glory is their ill.

He from the happy knowledge of the wise

Draws virtue to reprove secured fools

And shuns the glad sleights of ensnaring vice

To spend his spring of days in sacred schools.

75
Here gave he diet to the sick desires

That day by day assault the weaker man,

And with fit moderation still retires

From what doth batter virtue now and then.

But that I not intend in full discourse

80
To progress out his life, I could display

A good man in each part exact and force

The common voice to warrant what I say.

For if his fate and heaven had decreed

That full of days he might have lived to see

85
The grave in peace, the times that should succeed

Had been best-speaking witnesses with me;

Whose conversation so untouched did move

Respect most in itself, as who would scan

His honesty and worth, by them might prove

90
He was a kind, true, perfect gentleman.

Not in the outside of disgraceful folly,

Courting opinion with unfit disguise,

Affecting fashions, nor addicted wholly

To unbeseeming blushless vanities,

95
But suiting so his habit and desire

As that his virtue was his best attire.

Not in the waste of many idle words

Cared he to be heard talk, nor in the float

Of fond conceit, such as this age affords,

100
By vain discourse upon himself to dote;

For his becoming silence gave such grace

To his judicious parts, as what he spake

Seemed rather answers which the wise embrace

Than busy questions such as talkers make.

105
And though his qualities might well deserve

Just commendation, yet his furnished mind

Such harmony of goodness did preserve

As nature never built in better kind;

Knowing the best, and therefore not presuming

110
In knowing, but for that it was the best,

Ever within himself free choice resuming

Of true perfection, in a perfect breast;

So that his mind and body made an inn,

The one to lodge the other, both like framed

115
For fair conditions, guests that soonest win

Applause; in generality, well famed,

If trim behavior, gestures mild, discreet

Endeavors, modest speech, beseeming mirth,

True friendship, active grace, persuasion sweet,

120
Delightful love innated from his birth,

Acquaintance unfamiliar, carriage just,

Offenseless resolution, wished sobriety,

Clean-tempered moderation, steady trust,

Unburthened conscience, unfeigned piety;

125
If these, or all of these, knit fast in one

Can merit praise, then justly may we say,

Not any from this frailer stage is gone

Whose name is like to live a longer day. . .

Though not in eminent courts or places great

130
For popular concourse, yet in that soil

Where he enjoyed his birth, life, death, and seat

Which now sits mourning his untimely spoil.

And as much glory is it to be good

For private persons, in their private home,

135
As those descended from illustrious blood

In public view of greatness, whence they come.

Though I, rewarded with some sadder taste

Of knowing shame, by feeling it have proved

My country's thankless misconstruction cast

140
Upon my name and credit, both unloved

By some whose fortunes, sunk into the wane

Of plenty and desert, have strove to win

Justice by wrong, and sifted to embane

My reputation with a witless sin;

145
Yet time, the father of unblushing truth,

May one day lay ope malice which hath crossed it,

And right the hopes of my endangered youth,

Purchasing credit in the place I lost it.

Even in which place the subject of the verse

150
(Unhappy matter of a mourning style

Which now that subject's merits doth rehearse)

Had education and new being; while

By fair demeanor he had won repute

Amongst the all of all that lived there,

155
For that his actions did so wholly suit

With worthiness, still memorable here.

The many hours till the day of doom

Will not consume his life and hapless end,

For should he lie obscured without a tomb,

160
Time would to time his honesty commend;

Whiles parents to their children will make known,

And they to their posterity impart,

How such a man was sadly overthrown

By a hand guided by a cruel heart,

165
Whereof as many as shall hear that sadness

Will blame the one's hard fate, the other's madness;

Whiles such as do recount that tale of woe,

Told by remembrance of the wisest heads,

Will in the end conclude the matter so,

170
As they will all go weeping to their beds.

For when the world lies wintered in the storms

Of fearful consummation, and lays down

Th' unsteady change of his fantastic forms,

Expecting ever to be overthrown;

175
When the proud height of much affected sin

Shall ripen to a head, and in that pride

End in the miseries it did begin

And fall amidst the glory of his tide;

Then in a book where every work is writ

180
Shall this man's actions be revealed, to show

The gainful fruit of well-employed wit,

Which paid to heaven the debt that it did owe.

Here shall be reckoned up the constant faith,

Never untrue, where once he love professed;

185
Which is a miracle in men, one saith,

Long sought though rarely found, and he is best

Who can make friendship, in those times of change,

Admired more for being firm than strange.

When those weak houses of our brittle flesh

190
Shall ruined be by death, our grace and strength,

Youth, memory and shape that made us fresh

Cast down, and utterly decayed at length;

When all shall turn to dust from whence we came

And we low-leveled in a narrow grave,

195
What can we leave behind us but a name,

Which, by a life well led, may honor have?

Such honor, O thou youth untimely lost,

Thou didst deserve and hast; for though thy soul

Hath took her flight to a diviner coast,

200
Yet here on earth thy fame lives ever whole,

In every heart sealed up, in every tongue

Fit matter to discourse, no day prevented

That pities not thy sad and sudden wrong,

Of all alike beloved and lamented.

205
And I here to thy memorable worth,

In this last act of friendship, sacrifice

My love to thee, which I could not set forth

In any other habit of disguise.

Although I could not learn, whiles yet thou wert,

210
To speak the language of a servile breath,

My truth stole from my tongue into my heart,

Which shall not thence be sundered, but in death.

And I confess my love was too remiss

That had not made thee know how much I prized thee,

215
But that mine error was, as yet it is,

To think love best in silence: for I sized thee

By what I would have been, not only ready

In telling I was thine, but being so,

By some effect to show it.  He is steady

220
Who seems less than he is in open show.

Since then I still reserved to try the worst

Which hardest fate and time thus can lay on me.

T' enlarge my thoughts was hindered at first,

While thou hadst life; I took this task upon me,

225
To register with mine unhappy pen

Such duties as it owes to thy desert,

And set thee as a president to men,

And limn thee to the world but as thou wert. . .

Not hired, as heaven can witness in my soul,

230
By vain conceit, to please such ones as know it,

Nor servile to be liked, free from control,

Which, pain to many men, I do not owe it.

But here I trust I have discharged now

(Fair lovely branch too soon cut off) to thee,

235
My constant and irrefragable vow,

As, had it chanced, thou mightst have done to me. . .

But that no merit strong enough of mine

Had yielded store to thy well-abled quill

Whereby t' enroll my name, as this of thine,

240
How s'ere enriched by thy plenteous skill.

Here, then, I offer up to memory

The value of my talent, precious man,

Whereby if thou live to posterity,

Though 't be not as I would, 'tis as I can:

245
In minds from whence endeavor doth proceed,

A ready will is taken for the deed.

Yet ere I take my longest last farewell

From thee, fair mark of sorrow, let me frame

Some ampler work of thank, wherein to tell

250
What more thou didst deserve than in thy name,

And free thee from the scandal of such senses

As in the rancor of unhappy spleen

Measure thy course of life, with false pretenses

Comparing by thy death what thou hast been.

255
So in his mischiefs is the world accursed:

It picks out matter to inform the worst.

The willful blindness that hoodwinks the eyes

Of men enwrapped in an earthy veil

Makes them most ignorantly exercise

260
And yield to humor when it doth assail,

Whereby the candle and the body's light

Darkens the inward eyesight of the mind,

Presuming still it sees, even in the night

Of that same ignorance which makes them blind.

265
Hence conster they with corrupt commentaries,

Proceeding from a nature as corrupt,

The text of malice, which so often varies

As 'tis by seeming reason underpropped.

O, whither tends the lamentable spite

270
Of this world's teenful apprehension,

Which understands all things amiss, whose light

Shines not amidst the dark of their dissension?

True 'tis, this man, whiles yet he was a man,

Soothed not the current of besotted fashion,

275
Nor could disgest, as some loose mimics can,

An empty sound of overweening passion,

So much to be made servant to the base

And sensual aptness of disunioned vices,

To purchase commendation by disgrace,

280
Whereto the world and heat of sin entices.

But in a safer contemplation,

Secure in what he knew, he ever chose

The ready way to commendation,

By shunning all invitements strange, of those

285
Whose illness is, the necessary praise

Must wait upon their actions; only rare

In being rare in shame (which strives to raise

Their name by doing what they do not care),

As if the free commission of their ill

290
Were even as boundless as their prompt desires;

Only like lords, like subjects to their will,

Which their fond dotage ever more admires.

He was not so: but in a serious awe,

Ruling the little ordered commonwealth

295
Of his own self, with honor to the law

That gave peace to his bread, bread to his health;

Which ever he maintained in sweet content

And pleasurable rest, wherein he joyed

A monarchy of comfort's government,

300
Never until his last to be destroyed.

For in the vineyard of heaven-favored learning

Where he was double-honored in degree,

His observation and discreet discerning

Had taught him in both fortunes to be free;

305
Whence now retired home, to a home indeed

The home of his condition and estate,

He well provided 'gainst the hand of need,

Whence young men sometime grow unfortunate;

His disposition, by the bonds of unity,

310
So fastened to his reason that it strove

With understanding's grave immunity

To purchase from all hearts a steady love;

Wherein not any one thing comprehends

Proportionable note of what he was,

315
Than that he was so constant to his friends

As he would no occasion overpass

Which might make known his unaffected care,

In all respects of trial, to unlock

His bosom and his store, which did declare

320
That Christ was his, and he was friendship's rock:

A rock of friendship figured in his name,

Foreshowing what he was, and what should be,

Most true presage; and he discharged the same

In every act of perfect amity.

325
Though in the complemental phrase of words

He never was addicted to the vain

Of boast, such as the common breath affords;

He was in use most fast, in tongue most plain,

Nor amongst all those virtues that forever

330
Adorned his reputation will be found

One greater than his faith, which did persever,

Where once it was protested, alway sound.

Hence sprung the deadly fuel that revived

The rage which wrought his end, for had he been

335
Slacker in love, he had been longer lived

And not oppressed by wrath's unhappy sin. . .

By wrath's unhappy sin, which unadvised

Gave death for free good will, and wounds for love.

Pity it was that blood had not been prized

340
At higher rate, and reason set above

Most unjust choler, which untimely drew

Destruction on itself; and most unjust,

Robbed virtue of a follower so true

As time can boast of, both for love and trust:

345
So henceforth all (great glory to his blood)

Shall be but seconds to him, being good.

The wicked end their honor with their sin

In death, which only then the good begin.

Lo, here a lesson by experience taught

350
For men whose pure simplicity hath drawn

Their trust to be betrayed by being caught

Within the snares of making truth a pawn;

Whiles it, not doubting whereinto it enters,

Without true proof and knowledge of a friend,

355
Sincere in singleness of heart, adventers

To give fit cause, ere love begin to end:

His unfeigned friendship where it least was sought,

Him to a fatal timeless ruin brought;

Whereby the life that purity adorned

360
With real merit, by this sudden end

Is in the mouth of some in manner scorned,

Made questionable, for they do intend,

According to the tenor of the saw

Mistook, if not observed (writ long ago

365
When men were only led by reason's law),

That "Such as is the end, the life proves so."

Thus he, who to the universal lapse

Gave sweet redemption, offering up his blood

To conquer death by death, and loose the traps

370
Of hell, even in the triumph that it stood:

He thus, for that his guiltless life was spilt

By death, which was made subject to the curse,

Might in like manner be reproved of guilt

In his pure life, for that his end was worse.

375
But O far be it, our unholy lips

Should so profane the deity above

As thereby to ordain revenging whips

Against the day of judgment and of love.

The hand that lends us honor in our days

380
May shorten when it please, and justly take

Our honor from us many sundry ways,

As best becomes that wisdom did us make.

The second brother, who was next begot

Of all that ever were begotten yet,

385
Was by a hand in vengeance rude and hot

Sent innocent to be in heaven set.

Whose fame the angels in melodious choirs

Still witness to the world.  Then why should he,

Well-profited in excellent desires,

390
Be more rebuked, who had like destiny?

Those saints before the everlasting throne

Who sit with crowns of glory on their heads,

Washed white in blood, from earth hence have not gone

All to their joys in quiet on their beds,

395
But tasted of the sour-bitter scourge

Of torture and affliction ere they gained

Those blessings which their sufferance did urge,

Whereby the grace fore-promised they attained.

Let then the false suggestions of the froward,

400
Building large castles in the empty air,

By suppositions fond and thoughts untoward

(Issues of discontent and sick despair)

Rebound gross arguments upon their heart

That may disprove their malice, and confound

405
Uncivil loose opinions which insert

Their souls into the roll that doth unsound

Betraying policies, and show their brains,

Unto their shame, ridiculous; whose scope

Is envy, whose endeavors fruitless pains,

410
In nothing surely prosperous, but hope. . .

And that same hope, so lame, so unprevailing,

It buries self-conceit in weak opinion;

Which being crossed, gives matter of bewailing

Their vain designs, on whom want hath dominion.

415
Such, and of such condition, may devise

Which way to wound with defamation's spirit

(Close-lurking whisper's hidden forgeries)

His taintless goodness, his desertful merit.

But whiles the minds of men can judge sincerely,

420
Upon assured knowledge, his repute

And estimation shall be rumored clearly

In equal worth--time shall to time renew 't.

The grave, that in his ever-empty womb

Forever closes up the unrespected,

425
Who when they die, die all, shall not entomb

His pleading best perfections as neglected.

They to his notice in succeeding years

Shall speak for him when he shall lie below;

When nothing but his memory appears

430
Of what he was, then shall his virtues grow.

His being but a private man in rank

(And yet not ranked beneath a gentleman)

Shall not abridge the commendable thank

Which wise posterity shall give him then;

435
For nature, and his therein happy fate.

Ordained that by his quality of mind

T' ennoble that best part, although his state

Were to a lower blessedness confined.

Blood, pomp, state, honor, glory and command,

440
Without fit ornaments of disposition,

Are in themselves but heathenish and profaned,

And much more peaceful is a mean condition

Which, underneath the roof of safe content,

Feeds on the bread of rest, and takes delight

445
To look upon the labors it hath spent

For its own sustenance, both day and night;

Whiles others, plotting which way to be great,

How to augment their portion and ambition,

Do toil their giddy brains, and ever sweat

450
For popular applause and power's commission.

But one in honors, like a seeled dove

Whose inward eyes are dimmed with dignity,

Does think most safety doth remain above,

And seeks to be secure by mounting high:

455
Whence, when he falls, who did erewhile aspire,

Falls deeper down, for that he climbed higher.

Now men who in lower region live

Exempt from danger of authority

Have fittest times in reason's rules to thrive,

460
Not vexed with envy of priority,

And those are much more noble in the mind

Than many that have nobleness by kind.

Birth, blood, and ancestors, are none of ours,

Nor can we make a proper challenge to them

465
But virtues and perfections in our powers

Proceed most truly from us, if we do them.

Respective titles or a gracious style,

With all what men in eminence possess,

Are, without ornaments to praise them, vile:

470
The beauty of the mind is nobleness.

And such as have that beauty, well deserve

Eternal characters, that after death

Remembrance of their worth we may preserve,

So that their glory die not with their breath.

475
Else what avails it in a goodly strife

Upon this face of earth here to contend,

The good t' exceed the wicked in their life,

Should both be like obscured in their end?

Until which end, there is none rightly can

480
Be termed happy, since the happiness

Depends upon the goodness of the man,

Which afterwards his praises will express.

Look hither then, you that enjoy the youth

Of your best days, and see how unexpected

485
Death can betray your jollity to ruth

When death you think is least to be respected!

The person of this model here set out

Had all that youth and happy days could give him,

Yet could not all-encompass him about

490
Against th' assault of death, who to relieve him

Strook home but to the frail and mortal parts

Of his humanity, but could not touch

His flourishing and fair long-lived deserts,

Above fate's reach, his singleness was such.

495
So that he dies but once, but doubly lives,

Once in his proper self, then in his name;

Predestinated time, who all deprives,

Could never yet deprive him of the same.

And had the genius which attended on him

500
Been possibilited to keep him safe

Against the rigor that hath overgone him,

He had been to the public use a staff,

Leading by his example in the path

Which guides to doing well, wherein so few

505
The proneness of this age to error hath

Informed rightly in the courses true.

As then the loss of one, whose inclination

Stove to win love in general, is sad,

So specially his friends, in soft compassion

510
Do feel the greatest loss they could have had.

Amongst them all, she who those nine of years

Lived fellow to his counsels and his bed

Hath the most share in loss; for I in hers

Feel what distemperature this chance hath bred.

515
The chaste embracements of conjugal love,

Who in a mutual harmony consent,

Are so impatient of a strange remove

As meager death itself seems to lament,

And weep upon those cheeks which nature framed

520
To be delightful orbs in whom the force

Of lively sweetness plays, so that ashamed

Death often pities his unkind divorce.

Such was the separation here constrained

(Well-worthy to be termed a rudeness rather),

525
For in his life his love was so unfeigned

As he was both an husband and a father. . .

The one in firm affection and the other

In careful providence, which ever strove

With joint assistance to grace one another

530
With every helpful furtherance of love.

But since the sum of all that can be said

Can be but said that "He was good" (which wholly

Includes all excellence can be displayed

In praise of virtue and reproach of folly).

535
His due deserts, this sentence on him gives,

"He died in life, yet in his death he lives."

Now runs the method of this doleful song

In accents brief to thee, O thou deceased!

To whom those pains do only all belong

540
As witnesses I did not love thee least.

For could my worthless brain find out but how

To raise thee from the sepulcher of dust,

Undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now

Of life with me, and heaven be counted just

545
If to a supplicating soul it would

Give life anew, by giving life again

Where life is missed; whereby discomfort should

Right his old griefs, and former joys retain

Which now with thee are leaped into thy tomb

550
And buried in that hollow vault of woe,

Expecting yet a more severer doom

Than time's strict flinty hand will let 'em know.

And now if I have leveled mine account

And reckoned up in a true measured score

555
Those perfect graces which were ever wont

To wait on thee alive, I ask no more

(But shall hereafter in a poor content

Immure those imputations I sustain,

Learning my days of youth so to prevent

560
As not to be cast down by them again);

Only those hopes which fate denies to grant

In full possession to a captive heart

Who, if it were in plenty, still would want

Before it may enjoy his better part:

565
From which detained, and banished in th' exile

Of dim misfortune, has none other prop

Whereon to lean and rest itself the while

But the weak comfort of the hapless, "hope."

And hope must in despite of fearful change

570
Play in the strongest closet of my breast,

Although perhaps I ignorantly range

And court opinion in my deep'st unrest.

But whether doth the stream of my mischance

Drive me beyond myself, fast friend, soon lost,

575
Long may thy worthiness thy name advance

Amongst the virtuous and deserving most,

Who herein hast forever happy proved:

In life thou lived'st, in death thou died'st beloved.


ill hie,

And so bestow these papers as you bade me.


CASSIUS

That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.


Exit CINNA

Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day

See Brutus at his house: three parts of him

Is ours already, and the man entire

Upon the next encounter yields him ours.


CASCA

O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:

And that which would appear offence in us,

His countenance, like richest alchemy,

Will change to virtue and to worthiness.


CASSIUS

Him and his worth and our great need of him

You have right well conceited. Let us go,

For it is after midnight; and ere day

We will awake him and be sure of him.


Exeunt


ACT II
SCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.

Enter BRUTUS

BRUTUS

What, Lucius, ho!

I cannot, by the progress of the stars,

Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!

I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.

When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!


Enter LUCIUS


LUCIUS

Call'd you, my lord?


BRUTUS

Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:

When it is lighted, come and call me here.


LUCIUS

I will, my lord.


Exit


BRUTUS

It must be by his death: and for my part,

I know no personal cause to spurn at him,

But for the general. He would be crown'd:

How that might change his nature, there's the question.

It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;

And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--

And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,

That at his will he may do danger with.

The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins

Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,

I have not known when his affections sway'd

More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,

That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,

Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;

But when he once attains the upmost round.

He then unto the ladder turns his back,

Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees

By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.

Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel

Will bear no colour for the thing he is,

Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,

Would run to these and these extremities:

And therefore think him as a serpent's egg

Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,

And kill him in the shell.


Re-enter LUCIUS


LUCIUS

The taper burneth in your closet, sir.

Searching the window for a flint, I found

This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,

It did not lie there when I went to bed.


Gives him the letter


BRUTUS

Get you to bed again; it is not day.

Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?


LUCIUS

I know not, sir.


BRUTUS

Look in the calendar, and bring me word.


LUCIUS

I will, sir.


Exit


BRUTUS

The exhalations whizzing in the air

Give so much light that I may read by them.


Opens the letter and reads

'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.

Shall Rome,  & c. Speak, strike, redress!

Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'

Such instigations have been often dropp'd

Where I have took them up.

'Shall Rome,  & c.' Thus must I piece it out:

Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?

My ancestors did from the streets of Rome

The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.

'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated

To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:

If the redress will follow, thou receivest

Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!


Re-enter LUCIUS


LUCIUS

Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.


Knocking within


BRUTUS

'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.


Exit LUCIUS

Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,

I have not slept.

Between the acting of a dreadful thing

And the first motion, all the interim is

Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:

The Genius and the mortal instruments

Are then in council; and the state of man,

Like to a little kingdom, suffers then

The nature of an insurrection.


Re-enter LUCIUS


LUCIUS

Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,

Who doth desire to see you.


BRUTUS

Is he alone?


LUCIUS

No, sir, there are moe with him.


BRUTUS

Do you know them?


LUCIUS

No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,

And half their faces buried in their cloaks,

That by no means I may discover them

By any mark of favour.


BRUTUS

Let 'em enter.


Exit LUCIUS

They are the faction. O conspiracy,

Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,

When evils are most free? O, then by day

Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough

To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;

Hide it in smiles and affability:

For if thou path, thy native semblance on,

Not Erebus itself were dim enough

To hide thee from prevention.


Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS


CASSIUS

I think we are too bold upon your rest:

Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?


BRUTUS

I have been up this hour, awake all night.

Know I these men that come along with you?


CASSIUS

Yes, every man of them, and no man here

But honours you; and every one doth wish

You had but that opinion of yourself

Which every noble Roman bears of you.

This is Trebonius.


BRUTUS

                  He is welcome hither.


CASSIUS

This, Decius Brutus.


BRUTUS

He is welcome too.


CASSIUS

This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.


BRUTUS

They are all welcome.

What watchful cares do interpose themselves

Betwixt your eyes and night?


CASSIUS

Shall I entreat a word?


BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper


DECIUS BRUTUS

Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?


CASCA

No.


CINNA

O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines

That fret the clouds are messengers of day.


CASCA

You shall confess that you are both deceived.

Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,

Which is a great way growing on the south,

Weighing the youthful season of the year.

Some two months hence up higher toward the north

He first presents his fire; and the high east

Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.


BRUTUS

Give me your hands all over, one by one.


CASSIUS

And let us swear our resolution.


BRUTUS

No, not an oath: if not the face of men,

The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--

If these be motives weak, break off betimes,

And every man hence to his idle bed;

So let high-sighted tyranny range on,

Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,

As I am sure they do, bear fire enough

To kindle cowards and to steel with valour

The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,

What need we any spur but our own cause,

To prick us to redress? what other bond

Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,

And will not palter? and what other oath

Than honesty to honesty engaged,

That this shall be, or we will fall for it?

Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,

Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls

That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear

Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain

The even virtue of our enterprise,

Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,

To think that or our cause or our performance

Did need an oath; when every drop of blood

That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,

Is guilty of a several bastardy,

If he do break the smallest particle

Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.


CASSIUS

But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?

I think he will stand very strong with us.


CASCA

Let us not leave him out.


CINNA

No, by no means.


METELLUS CIMBER

O, let us have him, for his silver hairs

Will purchase us a good opinion

And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:

It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;

Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,

But all be buried in his gravity.


BRUTUS

O, name him not: let us not break with him;

For he will never follow any thing

That other men begin.


CASSIUS

Then leave him out.


CASCA

Indeed he is not fit.


DECIUS BRUTUS

Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?


CASSIUS

Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,

Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,

Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him

A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,

If he improve them, may well stretch so far

As to annoy us all: which to prevent,

Let Antony and Caesar fall together.


BRUTUS

Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,

To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,

Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;

For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:

Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.

We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;

And in the spirit of men there is no blood:

O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,

And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,

Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,

Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;

Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,

Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:

And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,

Stir up their servants to an act of rage,

And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make

Our purpose necessary and not envious:

Which so appearing to the common eyes,

We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.

And for Mark Antony, think not of him;

For he can do no more than Caesar's arm

When Caesar's head is off.


CASSIUS

Yet I fear him;

For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--


BRUTUS

Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:

If he love Caesar, all that he can do

Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:

And that were much he should; for he is given

To sports, to wildness and much company.


TREBONIUS

There is no fear in him; let him not die;

For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.


Clock strikes


BRUTUS

Peace! count the clock.


CASSIUS

The clock hath stricken three.


TREBONIUS

'Tis time to part.


CASSIUS

                  But it is doubtful yet,

Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;

For he is superstitious grown of late,

Quite from the main opinion he held once

Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:

It may be, these apparent prodigies,

The unaccustom'd terror of this night,

And the persuasion of his augurers,

May hold him from the Capitol to-day.


DECIUS BRUTUS

Never fear that: if he be so resolved,

I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear

That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,

And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,

Lions with toils and men with flatterers;

But when I tell him he hates flatterers,

He says he does, being then most flattered.

Let me work;

For I can give his humour the true bent,

And I will bring him to the Capitol.


CASSIUS

Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.


BRUTUS

By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?


CINNA

Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.


METELLUS CIMBER

Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,

Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:

I wonder none of you have thought of him.


BRUTUS

Now, good Metellus, go along by him:

He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;

Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.


CASSIUS

The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.

And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember

What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.


BRUTUS

Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;

Let not our looks put on our purposes,

But bear it as our Roman actors do,

With untired spirits and formal constancy:

And so good morrow to you every one.


Exeunt all but BRUTUS

Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;

Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:

Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,

Which busy care draws in the brains of men;

Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.


Enter PORTIA


PORTIA

Brutus, my lord!


BRUTUS

Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?

It is not for your health thus to commit

Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.


PORTIA

Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,

Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,

You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,

Musing and sighing, with your arms across,

And when I ask'd you what the matter was,

You stared upon me with ungentle looks;

I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,

And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;

Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,

But, with an angry wafture of your hand,

Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;

Fearing to strengthen that impatience

Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal

Hoping it was but an effect of humour,

Which sometime hath his hour with every man.

It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,

And could it work so much upon your shape

As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,

I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,

Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.


BRUTUS

I am not well in health, and that is all.


PORTIA

Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,

He would embrace the means to come by it.


BRUTUS

Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.


PORTIA

Is Brutus sick? and is it physical

To walk unbraced and suck up the humours

Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,

And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,

To dare the vile contagion of the night

And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air

To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;

You have some sick offence within your mind,

Which, by the right and virtue of my place,

I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,

I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,

By all your vows of love and that great vow

Which did incorporate and make us one,

That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,

Why you are heavy, and what men to-night

Have had to resort to you: for here have been

Some six or seven, who did hide their faces

Even from darkness.


BRUTUS

Kneel not, gentle Portia.


PORTIA

I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.

Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,

Is it excepted I should know no secrets

That appertain to you? Am I yourself

But, as it were, in sort or limitation,

To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,

And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs

Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,

Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.


BRUTUS

You are my true and honourable wife,

As dear to me as are the ruddy drops

That visit my sad heart


PORTIA

If this were true, then should I know this secret.

I grant I am a woman; but withal

A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:

I grant I am a woman; but withal

A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.

Think you I am no stronger than my sex,

Being so father'd and so husbanded?

Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:

I have made strong proof of my constancy,

Giving myself a voluntary wound

Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.

And not my husband's secrets?


BRUTUS

O ye gods,

Render me worthy of this noble wife!


Knocking within

Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;

And by and by thy bosom shall partake

The secrets of my heart.

All my engagements I will construe to thee,

All the charactery of my sad brows:

Leave me with haste.


Exit PORTIA

Lucius, who's that knocks?


Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS


LUCIUS

He is a sick man that would speak with you.


BRUTUS

Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.

Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?


LIGARIUS

Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.


BRUTUS

O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,

To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!


LIGARIUS

I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand

Any exploit worthy the name of honour.


BRUTUS

Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,

Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.


LIGARIUS

By all the gods that Romans bow before,

I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!

Brave son, derived from honourable loins!

Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up

My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,

And I will strive with things impossible;

Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?


BRUTUS

A piece of work that will make sick men whole.


LIGARIUS

But are not some whole that we must make sick?


BRUTUS

That must we also. What it is, my Caius,

I shall unfold to thee, as we are going

To whom it must be done.


LIGARIUS

Set on your foot,

And with a heart new-fired I follow you,

To do I know not what: but it sufficeth

That Brutus leads me on.


BRUTUS

Follow me, then.


Exeunt

SCENE II. CAESAR's house.

Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gown

CAESAR

Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:

Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,

'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?


Enter a Servant


Servant

My lord?


CAESAR

Go bid the priests do present sacrifice

And bring me their opinions of success.


Servant

I will, my lord.


Exit


Enter CALPURNIA


CALPURNIA

What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?

You shall not stir out of your house to-day.


CAESAR

Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me

Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see

The face of Caesar, they are vanished.


CALPURNIA

Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,

Yet now they fright me. There is one within,

Besides the things that we have heard and seen,

Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.

A lioness hath whelped in the streets;

And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;

Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,

In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,

Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;

The noise of battle hurtled in the air,

Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,

And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.

O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,

And I do fear them.


CAESAR

What can be avoided

Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?

Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions

Are to the world in general as to Caesar.


CALPURNIA

When beggars die, there are no comets seen;

The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.


CAESAR

Cowards die many times before their deaths;

The valiant never taste of death but once.

Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.

It seems to me most strange that men should fear;

Seeing that death, a necessary end,

Will come when it will come.


Re-enter Servant

What say the augurers?


Servant

They would not have you to stir forth to-day.

Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,

They could not find a heart within the beast.


CAESAR

The gods do this in shame of cowardice:

Caesar should be a beast without a heart,

If he should stay at home to-day for fear.

No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well

That Caesar is more dangerous than he:

We are two lions litter'd in one day,

And I the elder and more terrible:

And Caesar shall go forth.


CALPURNIA

Alas, my lord,

Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.

Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear

That keeps you in the house, and not your own.

We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:

And he shall say you are not well to-day:

Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.


CAESAR

Mark Antony shall say I am not well,

And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.


Enter DECIUS BRUTUS

Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.


DECIUS BRUTUS

Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:

I come to fetch you to the senate-house.


CAESAR

And you are come in very happy time,

To bear my greeting to the senators

And tell them that I will not come to-day:

Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:

I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.


CALPURNIA

Say he is sick.


CAESAR

                  Shall Caesar send a lie?

Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,

To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?

Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.


DECIUS BRUTUS

Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,

Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.


CAESAR

The cause is in my will: I will not come;

That is enough to satisfy the senate.

But for your private satisfaction,

Because I love you, I will let you know:

Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:

She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,

Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,

Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans

Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:

And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,

And evils imminent; and on her knee

Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.


DECIUS BRUTUS

This dream is all amiss interpreted;

It was a vision fair and fortunate:

Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,

In which so many smiling Romans bathed,

Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck

Reviving blood, and that great men shall press

For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.

This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.


CAESAR

And this way have you well expounded it.


DECIUS BRUTUS

I have, when you have heard what I can say:

And know it now: the senate have concluded

To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.

If you shall send them word you will not come,

Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock

Apt to be render'd, for some one to say

'Break up the senate till another time,

When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'

If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper

'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?

Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love

To our proceeding bids me tell you this;

And reason to my love is liable.


CAESAR

How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!

I am ashamed I did yield to them.

Give me my robe, for I will go.


Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA

And look where Publius is come to fetch me.


PUBLIUS

Good morrow, Caesar.


CAESAR

Welcome, Publius.

What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?

Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,

Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy

As that same ague which hath made you lean.

What is 't o'clock?


BRUTUS

Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.


CAESAR

I thank you for your pains and courtesy.


Enter ANTONY

See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,

Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.


ANTONY

So to most noble Caesar.


CAESAR

Bid them prepare within:

I am to blame to be thus waited for.

Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!

I have an hour's talk in store for you;

Remember that you call on me to-day:

Be near me, that I may remember you.


TREBONIUS

Caesar, I will:


Aside

and so near will I be,

That your best friends shall wish I had been further.


CAESAR

Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;

And we, like friends, will straightway go together.


BRUTUS

[Aside]  That every like is not the same, O Caesar,

The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!


Exeunt

SCENE III. A street near the Capitol.

Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paper

ARTEMIDORUS

'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;

come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not

Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus

loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.

There is but one mind in all these men, and it is

bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,

look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.

The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,

'ARTEMIDORUS.'

Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,

And as a suitor will I give him this.

My heart laments that virtue cannot live

Out of the teeth of emulation.

If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;

If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.


Exit

SCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS.

Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS

PORTIA

I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;

Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:

Why dost thou stay?


LUCIUS

To know my errand, madam.


PORTIA

I would have had thee there, and here again,

Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.

O constancy, be strong upon my side,

Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!

I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.

How hard it is for women to keep counsel!

Art thou here yet?


LUCIUS

                  Madam, what should I do?

Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?

And so return to you, and nothing else?


PORTIA

Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,

For he went sickly forth: and take good note

What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.

Hark, boy! what noise is that?


LUCIUS

I hear none, madam.


PORTIA

Prithee, listen well;

I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,

And the wind brings it from the Capitol.


LUCIUS

Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.


Enter the Soothsayer


PORTIA

Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?


Soothsayer

At mine own house, good lady.


PORTIA

What is't o'clock?


Soothsayer

                  About the ninth hour, lady.


PORTIA

Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?


Soothsayer

Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,

To see him pass on to the Capitol.


PORTIA

Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?


Soothsayer

That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar

To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,

I shall beseech him to befriend himself.


PORTIA

Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?


Soothsayer

None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.

Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:

The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,

Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,

Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:

I'll get me to a place more void, and there

Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.


Exit


PORTIA

I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing

The heart of woman is! O Brutus,

The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!

Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit

That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.

Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;

Say I am merry: come to me again,

And bring me word what he doth say to thee.


Exeunt severally


ACT III
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.

A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the  Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, METELLUS CIMBER,  TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS, PUBLIUS, and others

CAESAR

[To the Soothsayer]  The ides of March are come.


Soothsayer

Ay, Caesar; but not gone.


ARTEMIDORUS

Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.


DECIUS BRUTUS

Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,

At your best leisure, this his humble suit.


ARTEMIDORUS

O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit

That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.


CAESAR

What touches us ourself shall be last served.


ARTEMIDORUS

Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.


CAESAR

What, is the fellow mad?


PUBLIUS

Sirrah, give place.


CASSIUS

What, urge you your petitions in the street?

Come to the Capitol.


CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest following


POPILIUS

I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.


CASSIUS

What enterprise, Popilius?


POPILIUS

Fare you well.


Advances to CAESAR


BRUTUS

What said Popilius Lena?


CASSIUS

He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.

I fear our purpose is discovered.


BRUTUS

Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.


CASSIUS

Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.

Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,

Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,

For I will slay myself.


BRUTUS

Cassius, be constant:

Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;

For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.


CASSIUS

Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.

He draws Mark Antony out of the way.


Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS


DECIUS BRUTUS

Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,

And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.


BRUTUS

He is address'd: press near and second him.


CINNA

Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.


CAESAR

Are we all ready? What is now amiss

That Caesar and his senate must redress?


METELLUS CIMBER

Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,

Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat

An humble heart,--


Kneeling


CAESAR

                  I must prevent thee, Cimber.

These couchings and these lowly courtesies

Might fire the blood of ordinary men,

And turn pre-ordinance and first decree

Into the law of children. Be not fond,

To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood

That will be thaw'd from the true quality

With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,

Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.

Thy brother by decree is banished:

If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,

I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.

Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause

Will he be satisfied.


METELLUS CIMBER

Is there no voice more worthy than my own

To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear

For the repealing of my banish'd brother?


BRUTUS

I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;

Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may

Have an immediate freedom of repeal.


CAESAR

What, Brutus!


CASSIUS

                  Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:

As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,

To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.


CASSIUS

I could be well moved, if I were as you:

If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:

But I am constant as the northern star,

Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality

There is no fellow in the firmament.

The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,

They are all fire and every one doth shine,

But there's but one in all doth hold his place:

So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,

And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;

Yet in the number I do know but one

That unassailable holds on his rank,

Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,

Let me a little show it, even in this;

That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,

And constant do remain to keep him so.


CINNA

O Caesar,--


CAESAR

          Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?


DECIUS BRUTUS

Great Caesar,--


CAESAR

                  Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?


CASCA

Speak, hands for me!


CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and BRUTUS stab CAESAR


CAESAR

Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.


Dies


CINNA

Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!

Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.


CASSIUS

Some to the common pulpits, and cry out

'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'


BRUTUS

People and senators, be not affrighted;

Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.


CASCA

Go to the pulpit, Brutus.


DECIUS BRUTUS

And Cassius too.


BRUTUS

Where's Publius?


CINNA

Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.


METELLUS CIMBER

Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's

Should chance--


BRUTUS

Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;

There is no harm intended to your person,

Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.


CASSIUS

And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,

Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.


BRUTUS

Do so: and let no man abide this deed,

But we the doers.


Re-enter TREBONIUS


CASSIUS

                  Where is Antony?


TREBONIUS

Fled to his house amazed:

Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run

As it were doomsday.


BRUTUS

Fates, we will know your pleasures:

That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time

And drawing days out, that men stand upon.


CASSIUS

Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life

Cuts off so many years of fearing death.


BRUTUS

Grant that, and then is death a benefit:

So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged

His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,

And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood

Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:

Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,

And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,

Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'


CASSIUS

Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence

Shall this our lofty scene be acted over

In states unborn and accents yet unknown!


BRUTUS

How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,

That now on Pompey's basis lies along

No worthier than the dust!


CASSIUS

So oft as that shall be,

So often shall the knot of us be call'd

The men that gave their country liberty.


DECIUS BRUTUS

What, shall we forth?


CASSIUS

Ay, every man away:

Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels

With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.


Enter a Servant


BRUTUS

Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.


Servant

Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:

Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;

And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:

Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;

Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:

Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;

Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.

If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony

May safely come to him, and be resolved

How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,

Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead

So well as Brutus living; but will follow

The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus

Thorough the hazards of this untrod state

With all true faith. So says my master Antony.


BRUTUS

Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;

I never thought him worse.

Tell him, so please him come unto this place,

He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,

Depart untouch'd.


Servant

                  I'll fetch him presently.


Exit


BRUTUS

I know that we shall have him well to friend.


CASSIUS

I wish we may: but yet have I a mind

That fears him much; and my misgiving still

Falls shrewdly to the purpose.


BRUTUS

But here comes Antony.


Re-enter ANTONY

Welcome, Mark Antony.


ANTONY

O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?

Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,

Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.

I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,

Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:

If I myself, there is no hour so fit

As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument

Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich

With the most noble blood of all this world.

I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,

Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,

Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,

I shall not find myself so apt to die:

No place will please me so, no mean of death,

As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,

The choice and master spirits of this age.


BRUTUS

O Antony, beg not your death of us.

Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,

As, by our hands and this our present act,

You see we do, yet see you but our hands

And this the bleeding business they have done:

Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;

And pity to the general wrong of Rome--

As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--

Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,

To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:

Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts

Of brothers' temper, do receive you in

With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.


CASSIUS

Your voice shall be as strong as any man's

In the disposing of new dignities.


BRUTUS

Only be patient till we have appeased

The multitude, beside themselves with fear,

And then we will deliver you the cause,

Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,

Have thus proceeded.


ANTONY

I doubt not of your wisdom.

Let each man render me his bloody hand:

First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;

Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;

Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;

Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;

Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.

Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?

My credit now stands on such slippery ground,

That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,

Either a coward or a flatterer.

That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:

If then thy spirit look upon us now,

Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,

To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,

Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,

Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?

Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,

Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,

It would become me better than to close

In terms of friendship with thine enemies.

Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;

Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,

Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.

O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;

And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.

How like a deer, strucken by many princes,

Dost thou here lie!


CASSIUS

Mark Antony,--


ANTONY

                  Pardon me, Caius Cassius:

The enemies of Caesar shall say this;

Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.


CASSIUS

I blame you not for praising Caesar so;

But what compact mean you to have with us?

Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;

Or shall we on, and not depend on you?


ANTONY

Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,

Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.

Friends am I with you all and love you all,

Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons

Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.


BRUTUS

Or else were this a savage spectacle:

Our reasons are so full of good regard

That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,

You should be satisfied.


ANTONY

That's all I seek:

And am moreover suitor that I may

Produce his body to the market-place;

And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,

Speak in the order of his funeral.


BRUTUS

You shall, Mark Antony.


CASSIUS

Brutus, a word with you.


Aside to BRUTUS

You know not what you do: do not consent

That Antony speak in his funeral:

Know you how much the people may be moved

By that which he will utter?


BRUTUS

By your pardon;

I will myself into the pulpit first,

And show the reason of our Caesar's death:

What Antony shall speak, I will protest

He speaks by leave and by permission,

And that we are contented Caesar shall

Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.

It shall advantage more than do us wrong.


CASSIUS

I know not what may fall; I like it not.


BRUTUS

Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.

You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,

But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,

And say you do't by our permission;

Else shall you not have any hand at all

About his funeral: and you shall speak

In the same pulpit whereto I am going,

After my speech is ended.


ANTONY

Be it so.

I do desire no more.


BRUTUS

Prepare the body then, and follow us.


Exeunt all but ANTONY


ANTONY

O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,

That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!

Thou art the ruins of the noblest man

That ever lived in the tide of times.

Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!

Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--

Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,

To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--

A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;

Domestic fury and fierce civil strife

Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;

Blood and destruction shall be so in use

And dreadful objects so familiar

That mothers shall but smile when they behold

Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;

All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:

And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,

With Ate by his side come hot from hell,

Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice

Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;

That this foul deed shall smell above the earth

With carrion men, groaning for burial.


Enter a Servant

You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?


Servant

I do, Mark Antony.


ANTONY

Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.


Servant

He did receive his letters, and is coming;

And bid me say to you by word of mouth--

O Caesar!--


Seeing the body


ANTONY

Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.

Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,

Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,

Began to water. Is thy master coming?


Servant

He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.


ANTONY

Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:

Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,

No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;

Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;

Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse

Into the market-place: there shall I try

In my oration, how the people take

The cruel issue of these bloody men;

According to the which, thou shalt discourse

To young Octavius of the state of things.

Lend me your hand.


Exeunt with CAESAR's body

SCENE II. The Forum.

Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens

Citizens

We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.


BRUTUS

Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.

Cassius, go you into the other street,

And part the numbers.

Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;

Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;

And public reasons shall be rendered

Of Caesar's death.


First Citizen

                  I will hear Brutus speak.


Second Citizen

I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,

When severally we hear them rendered.


Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit


Third Citizen

The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!


BRUTUS

Be patient till the last.

Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my

cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me

for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that

you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and

awake your senses, that you may the better judge.

If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of

Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar

was no less than his. If then that friend demand

why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:

--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved

Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and

die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live

all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;

as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was

valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I

slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his

fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his

ambition. Who is here so base that would be a

bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.

Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If

any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so

vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;

for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.


All

None, Brutus, none.


BRUTUS

Then none have I offended. I have done no more to

Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of

his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not

extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences

enforced, for which he suffered death.


Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body

Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,

though he had no hand in his death, shall receive

the benefit of his dying, a place in the

commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this

I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the

good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,

when it shall please my country to need my death.


All

Live, Brutus! live, live!


First Citizen

Bring him with triumph home unto his house.


Second Citizen

Give him a statue with his ancestors.


Third Citizen

Let him be Caesar.


Fourth Citizen

                  Caesar's better parts

Shall be crown'd in Brutus.


First Citizen

We'll bring him to his house

With shouts and clamours.


BRUTUS

My countrymen,--


Second Citizen

Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.


First Citizen

Peace, ho!


BRUTUS

Good countrymen, let me depart alone,

And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:

Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech

Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,

By our permission, is allow'd to make.

I do entreat you, not a man depart,

Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.


Exit


First Citizen

Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.


Third Citizen

Let him go up into the public chair;

We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.


ANTONY

For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.


Goes into the pulpit


Fourth Citizen

What does he say of Brutus?


Third Citizen

He says, for Brutus' sake,

He finds himself beholding to us all.


Fourth Citizen

'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.


First Citizen

This Caesar was a tyrant.


Third Citizen

Nay, that's certain:

We are blest that Rome is rid of him.


Second Citizen

Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.


ANTONY

You gentle Romans,--


Citizens

Peace, ho! let us hear him.


ANTONY

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;

I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.

The evil that men do lives after them;

The good is oft interred with their bones;

So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus

Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:

If it were so, it was a grievous fault,

And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.

Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--

For Brutus is an honourable man;

So are they all, all honourable men--

Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.

He was my friend, faithful and just to me:

But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honourable man.

He hath brought many captives home to Rome

Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:

Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?

When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:

Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:

Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honourable man.

You all did see that on the Lupercal

I thrice presented him a kingly crown,

Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?

Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

And, sure, he is an honourable man.

I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,

But here I am to speak what I do know.

You all did love him once, not without cause:

What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?

O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;

My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,

And I must pause till it come back to me.


First Citizen

Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.


Second Citizen

If thou consider rightly of the matter,

Caesar has had great wrong.


Third Citizen

Has he, masters?

I fear there will a worse come in his place.


Fourth Citizen

Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;

Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.


First Citizen

If it be found so, some will dear abide it.


Second Citizen

Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.


Third Citizen

There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.


Fourth Citizen

Now mark him, he begins again to speak.


ANTONY

But yesterday the word of Caesar might

Have stood against the world; now lies he there.

And none so poor to do him reverence.

O masters, if I were disposed to stir

Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,

I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,

Who, you all know, are honourable men:

I will not do them wrong; I rather choose

To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,

Than I will wrong such honourable men.

But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;

I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:

Let but the commons hear this testament--

Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--

And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds

And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,

Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,

And, dying, mention it within their wills,

Bequeathing it as a rich legacy

Unto their issue.


Fourth Citizen

We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.


All

The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.


ANTONY

Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;

It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.

You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;

And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,

It will inflame you, it will make you mad:

'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;

For, if you should, O, what would come of it!


Fourth Citizen

Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;

You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.


ANTONY

Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?

I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:

I fear I wrong the honourable men

Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.


Fourth Citizen

They were traitors: honourable men!


All

The will! the testament!


Second Citizen

They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.


ANTONY

You will compel me, then, to read the will?

Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,

And let me show you him that made the will.

Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?


Several Citizens

Come down.


Second Citizen

Descend.


Third Citizen

You shall have leave.


ANTONY comes down


Fourth Citizen

A ring; stand round.


First Citizen

Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.


Second Citizen

Room for Antony, most noble Antony.


ANTONY

Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.


Several Citizens

Stand back; room; bear back.


ANTONY

If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.

You all do know this mantle: I remember

The first time ever Caesar put it on;

'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,

That day he overcame the Nervii:

Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:

See what a rent the envious Casca made:

Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;

And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,

Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,

As rushing out of doors, to be resolved

If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;

For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:

Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!

This was the most unkindest cut of all;

For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,

Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,

Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;

And, in his mantle muffling up his face,

Even at the base of Pompey's statua,

Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.

O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!

Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,

Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.

O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel

The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.

Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold

Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,

Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.


First Citizen

O piteous spectacle!


Second Citizen

O noble Caesar!


Third Citizen

O woful day!


Fourth Citizen

O traitors, villains!


First Citizen

O most bloody sight!


Second Citizen

We will be revenged.


All

Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!

Let not a traitor live!


ANTONY

Stay, countrymen.


First Citizen

Peace there! hear the noble Antony.


Second Citizen

We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.


ANTONY

Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up

To such a sudden flood of mutiny.

They that have done this deed are honourable:

What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,

That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,

And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.

I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:

I am no orator, as Brutus is;

But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,

That love my friend; and that they know full well

That gave me public leave to speak of him:

For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,

Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,

To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;

I tell you that which you yourselves do know;

Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,

And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,

And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony

Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue

In every wound of Caesar that should move

The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.


All

We'll mutiny.


First Citizen

We'll burn the house of Brutus.


Third Citizen

Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.


ANTONY

Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.


All

Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!


ANTONY

Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:

Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?

Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:

You have forgot the will I told you of.


All

Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.


ANTONY

Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.

To every Roman citizen he gives,

To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.


Second Citizen

Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.


Third Citizen

O royal Caesar!


ANTONY

Hear me with patience.


All

Peace, ho!


ANTONY

Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,

His private arbours and new-planted orchards,

On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,

And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,

To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.

Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?


First Citizen

Never, never. Come, away, away!

We'll burn his body in the holy place,

And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.

Take up the body.


Second Citizen

Go fetch fire.


Third Citizen

Pluck down benches.


Fourth Citizen

Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.


Exeunt Citizens with the body


ANTONY

Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,

Take thou what course thou wilt!


Enter a Servant

How now, fellow!


Servant

Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.


ANTONY

Where is he?


Servant

He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.


ANTONY

And thither will I straight to visit him:

He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,

And in this mood will give us any thing.


Servant

I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius

Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.


ANTONY

Belike they had some notice of the people,

How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.


Exeunt

SCENE III. A street.

Enter CINNA the poet

CINNA THE POET

I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,

And things unlucky charge my fantasy:

I have no will to wander forth of doors,

Yet something leads me forth.


Enter Citizens


First Citizen

What is your name?


Second Citizen

Whither are you going?


Third Citizen

Where do you dwell?


Fourth Citizen

Are you a married man or a bachelor?


Second Citizen

Answer every man directly.


First Citizen

Ay, and briefly.


Fourth Citizen

Ay, and wisely.


Third Citizen

Ay, and truly, you were best.


CINNA THE POET

What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I

dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to

answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and

truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.


Second Citizen

That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:

you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.


CINNA THE POET

Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.


First Citizen

As a friend or an enemy?


CINNA THE POET

As a friend.


Second Citizen

That matter is answered directly.


Fourth Citizen

For your dwelling,--briefly.


CINNA THE POET

Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.


Third Citizen

Your name, sir, truly.


CINNA THE POET

Truly, my name is Cinna.


First Citizen

Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.


CINNA THE POET

I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.


Fourth Citizen

Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.


CINNA THE POET

I am not Cinna the conspirator.


Fourth Citizen

It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his

name out of his heart, and turn him going.


Third Citizen

Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands:

to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius'

house, and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away, go!


Exeunt


ACT IV
SCENE I. A house in Rome.

ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table

ANTONY

These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.


OCTAVIUS

Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?


LEPIDUS

I do consent--


OCTAVIUS

                  Prick him down, Antony.


LEPIDUS

Upon condition Publius shall not live,

Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.


ANTONY

He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.

But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;

Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine

How to cut off some charge in legacies.


LEPIDUS

What, shall I find you here?


OCTAVIUS

Or here, or at the Capitol.


Exit LEPIDUS


ANTONY

This is a slight unmeritable man,

Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,

The three-fold world divided, he should stand

One of the three to share it?


OCTAVIUS

So you thought him;

And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,

In our black sentence and proscription.


ANTONY

Octavius, I have seen more days than you:

And though we lay these honours on this man,

To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,

He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,

To groan and sweat under the business,

Either led or driven, as we point the way;

And having brought our treasure where we will,

Then take we down his load, and turn him off,

Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,

And graze in commons.


OCTAVIUS

You may do your will;

But he's a tried and valiant soldier.


ANTONY

So is my horse, Octavius; and for that

I do appoint him store of provender:

It is a creature that I teach to fight,

To wind, to stop, to run directly on,

His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.

And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;

He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;

A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds

On abjects, orts and imitations,

Which, out of use and staled by other men,

Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,

But as a property. And now, Octavius,

Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius

Are levying powers: we must straight make head:

Therefore let our alliance be combined,

Our best friends made, our means stretch'd

And let us presently go sit in council,

How covert matters may be best disclosed,

And open perils surest answered.


OCTAVIUS

Let us do so: for we are at the stake,

And bay'd about with many enemies;

And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,

Millions of mischiefs.


Exeunt

SCENE II. Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.

Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them

BRUTUS

Stand, ho!


LUCILIUS

Give the word, ho! and stand.


BRUTUS

What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?


LUCILIUS

He is at hand; and Pindarus is come

To do you salutation from his master.


BRUTUS

He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,

In his own change, or by ill officers,

Hath given me some worthy cause to wish

Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,

I shall be satisfied.


PINDARUS

I do not doubt

But that my noble master will appear

Such as he is, full of regard and honour.


BRUTUS

He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;

How he received you, let me be resolved.


LUCILIUS

With courtesy and with respect enough;

But not with such familiar instances,

Nor with such free and friendly conference,

As he hath used of old.


BRUTUS

Thou hast described

A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,

When love begins to sicken and decay,

It useth an enforced ceremony.

There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;

But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,

Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;

But when they should endure the bloody spur,

They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,

Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?


LUCILIUS

They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;

The greater part, the horse in general,

Are come with Cassius.


BRUTUS

Hark! he is arrived.


Low march within

March gently on to meet him.


Enter CASSIUS and his powers


CASSIUS

Stand, ho!


BRUTUS

Stand, ho! Speak the word along.


First Soldier

Stand!


Second Soldier

Stand!


Third Soldier

Stand!


CASSIUS

Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.


BRUTUS

Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?

And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?


CASSIUS

Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;

And when you do them--


BRUTUS

Cassius, be content.

Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.

Before the eyes of both our armies here,

Which should perceive nothing but love from us,

Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;

Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,

And I will give you audience.


CASSIUS

Pindarus,

Bid our commanders lead their charges off

A little from this ground.


BRUTUS

Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man

Come to our tent till we have done our conference.

Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.


Exeunt

SCENE III. Brutus's tent.

Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS

CASSIUS

That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:

You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella

For taking bribes here of the Sardians;

Wherein my letters, praying on his side,

Because I knew the man, were slighted off.


BRUTUS

You wronged yourself to write in such a case.


CASSIUS

In such a time as this it is not meet

That every nice offence should bear his comment.


BRUTUS

Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself

Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;

To sell and mart your offices for gold

To undeservers.


CASSIUS

                  I an itching palm!

You know that you are Brutus that speak this,

Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.


BRUTUS

The name of Cassius honours this corruption,

And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.


CASSIUS

Chastisement!


BRUTUS

Remember March, the ides of March remember:

Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?

What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,

And not for justice? What, shall one of us

That struck the foremost man of all this world

But for supporting robbers, shall we now

Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,

And sell the mighty space of our large honours

For so much trash as may be grasped thus?

I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,

Than such a Roman.


CASSIUS

                  Brutus, bay not me;

I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,

To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,

Older in practise, abler than yourself

To make conditions.


BRUTUS

Go to; you are not, Cassius.


CASSIUS

I am.


BRUTUS

I say you are not.


CASSIUS

Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;

Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.


BRUTUS

Away, slight man!


CASSIUS

Is't possible?


BRUTUS

                  Hear me, for I will speak.

Must I give way and room to your rash choler?

Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?


CASSIUS

O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?


BRUTUS

All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;

Go show your slaves how choleric you are,

And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?

Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch

Under your testy humour? By the gods

You shall digest the venom of your spleen,

Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,

I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,

When you are waspish.


CASSIUS

Is it come to this?


BRUTUS

You say you are a better soldier:

Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,

And it shall please me well: for mine own part,

I shall be glad to learn of noble men.


CASSIUS

You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;

I said, an elder soldier, not a better:

Did I say 'better'?


BRUTUS

If you did, I care not.


CASSIUS

When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.


BRUTUS

Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.


CASSIUS

I durst not!


BRUTUS

No.


CASSIUS

What, durst not tempt him!


BRUTUS

For your life you durst not!


CASSIUS

Do not presume too much upon my love;

I may do that I shall be sorry for.


BRUTUS

You have done that you should be sorry for.

There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,

For I am arm'd so strong in honesty

That they pass by me as the idle wind,

Which I respect not. I did send to you

For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:

For I can raise no money by vile means:

By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,

And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring

From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash

By any indirection: I did send

To you for gold to pay my legions,

Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?

Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?

When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,

To lock such rascal counters from his friends,

Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;

Dash him to pieces!


CASSIUS

I denied you not.


BRUTUS

You did.


CASSIUS

I did not: he was but a fool that brought

My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:

A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,

But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.


BRUTUS

I do not, till you practise them on me.


CASSIUS

You love me not.


BRUTUS

                  I do not like your faults.


CASSIUS

A friendly eye could never see such faults.


BRUTUS

A flatterer's would not, though they do appear

As huge as high Olympus.


CASSIUS

Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,

Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,

For Cassius is aweary of the world;

Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;

Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,

Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,

To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep

My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,

And here my naked breast; within, a heart

Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:

If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;

I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:

Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,

When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better

Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.


BRUTUS

Sheathe your dagger:

Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;

Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.

O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb

That carries anger as the flint bears fire;

Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,

And straight is cold again.


CASSIUS

Hath Cassius lived

To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,

When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?


BRUTUS

When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.


CASSIUS

Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.


BRUTUS

And my heart too.


CASSIUS

                  O Brutus!


BRUTUS

What's the matter?


CASSIUS

Have not you love enough to bear with me,

When that rash humour which my mother gave me

Makes me forgetful?


BRUTUS

Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,

When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,

He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.


Poet

[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals;

There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet

They be alone.


LUCILIUS

[Within]  You shall not come to them.


Poet

[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.


Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS


CASSIUS

How now! what's the matter?


Poet

For shame, you generals! what do you mean?

Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;

For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.


CASSIUS

Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!


BRUTUS

Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!


CASSIUS

Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.


BRUTUS

I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:

What should the wars do with these jigging fools?

Companion, hence!


CASSIUS

                  Away, away, be gone.


Exit Poet


BRUTUS

Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders

Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.


CASSIUS

And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you

Immediately to us.


Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS


BRUTUS

Lucius, a bowl of wine!


Exit LUCIUS


CASSIUS

I did not think you could have been so angry.


BRUTUS

O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.


CASSIUS

Of your philosophy you make no use,

If you give place to accidental evils.


BRUTUS

No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.


CASSIUS

Ha! Portia!


BRUTUS

She is dead.


CASSIUS

How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?

O insupportable and touching loss!

Upon what sickness?


BRUTUS

Impatient of my absence,

And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony

Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death

That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,

And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.


CASSIUS

And died so?


BRUTUS

                  Even so.


CASSIUS

O ye immortal gods!


Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper


BRUTUS

Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.

In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.


CASSIUS

My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.

Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;

I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.


BRUTUS

Come in, Titinius!


Exit LUCIUS


Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA

Welcome, good Messala.

Now sit we close about this taper here,

And call in question our necessities.


CASSIUS

Portia, art thou gone?


BRUTUS

No more, I pray you.

Messala, I have here received letters,

That young Octavius and Mark Antony

Come down upon us with a mighty power,

Bending their expedition toward Philippi.


MESSALA

Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.


BRUTUS

With what addition?


MESSALA

That by proscription and bills of outlawry,

Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,

Have put to death an hundred senators.


BRUTUS

Therein our letters do not well agree;

Mine speak of seventy senators that died

By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.


CASSIUS

Cicero one!


MESSALA

          Cicero is dead,

And by that order of proscription.

Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?


BRUTUS

No, Messala.


MESSALA

Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?


BRUTUS

Nothing, Messala.


MESSALA

                  That, methinks, is strange.


BRUTUS

Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?


MESSALA

No, my lord.


BRUTUS

Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.


MESSALA

Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:

For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.


BRUTUS

Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:

With meditating that she must die once,

I have the patience to endure it now.


MESSALA

Even so great men great losses should endure.


CASSIUS

I have as much of this in art as you,

But yet my nature could not bear it so.


BRUTUS

Well, to our work alive. What do you think

Of marching to Philippi presently?


CASSIUS

I do not think it good.


BRUTUS

Your reason?


CASSIUS

This it is:

'Tis better that the enemy seek us:

So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,

Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,

Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.


BRUTUS

Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.

The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground

Do stand but in a forced affection;

For they have grudged us contribution:

The enemy, marching along by them,

By them shall make a fuller number up,

Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;

From which advantage shall we cut him off,

If at Philippi we do face him there,

These people at our back.


CASSIUS

Hear me, good brother.


BRUTUS

Under your pardon. You must note beside,

That we have tried the utmost of our friends,

Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:

The enemy increaseth every day;

We, at the height, are ready to decline.

There is a tide in the affairs of men,

Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;

Omitted, all the voyage of their life

Is bound in shallows and in miseries.

On such a full sea are we now afloat;

And we must take the current when it serves,

Or lose our ventures.


CASSIUS

Then, with your will, go on;

We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.


BRUTUS

The deep of night is crept upon our talk,

And nature must obey necessity;

Which we will niggard with a little rest.

There is no more to say?


CASSIUS

No more. Good night:

Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.


BRUTUS

Lucius!


Enter LUCIUS

My gown.


Exit LUCIUS

Farewell, good Messala:

Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,

Good night, and good repose.


CASSIUS

O my dear brother!

This was an ill beginning of the night:

Never come such division 'tween our souls!

Let it not, Brutus.


BRUTUS

Every thing is well.


CASSIUS

Good night, my lord.


BRUTUS

Good night, good brother.


TITINIUS


MESSALA

Good night, Lord Brutus.


BRUTUS

Farewell, every one.


Exeunt all but BRUTUS


Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown

Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?


LUCIUS

Here in the tent.


BRUTUS

                  What, thou speak'st drowsily?

Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.

Call Claudius and some other of my men:

I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.


LUCIUS

Varro and Claudius!


Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS


VARRO

Calls my lord?


BRUTUS

I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;

It may be I shall raise you by and by

On business to my brother Cassius.


VARRO

So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.


BRUTUS

I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;

It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.

Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;

I put it in the pocket of my gown.


VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down


LUCIUS

I was sure your lordship did not give it me.


BRUTUS

Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.

Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,

And touch thy instrument a strain or two?


LUCIUS

Ay, my lord, an't please you.


BRUTUS

It does, my boy:

I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.


LUCIUS

It is my duty, sir.


BRUTUS

I should not urge thy duty past thy might;

I know young bloods look for a time of rest.


LUCIUS

I have slept, my lord, already.


BRUTUS

It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;

I will not hold thee long: if I do live,

I will be good to thee.


Music, and a song

This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,

Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,

That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;

I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:

If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;

I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.

Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down

Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.


Enter the Ghost of CAESAR

How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?

I think it is the weakness of mine eyes

That shapes this monstrous apparition.

It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?

Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,

That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?

Speak to me what thou art.


GHOST

Thy evil spirit, Brutus.


BRUTUS

Why comest thou?


GHOST

To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.


BRUTUS

Well; then I shall see thee again?


GHOST

Ay, at Philippi.


BRUTUS

Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.


Exit Ghost

Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:

Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.

Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!


LUCIUS

The strings, my lord, are false.


BRUTUS

He thinks he still is at his instrument.

Lucius, awake!


LUCIUS

My lord?


BRUTUS

Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?


LUCIUS

My lord, I do not know that I did cry.


BRUTUS

Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?


LUCIUS

Nothing, my lord.


BRUTUS

Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!


To VARRO

Fellow thou, awake!


VARRO

My lord?


CLAUDIUS

My lord?


BRUTUS

Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?


VARRO


CLAUDIUS

Did we, my lord?


BRUTUS

Ay: saw you any thing?


VARRO

No, my lord, I saw nothing.


CLAUDIUS

Nor I, my lord.


BRUTUS

Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;

Bid him set on his powers betimes before,

And we will follow.


VARRO


CLAUDIUS

It shall be done, my lord.


Exeunt


ACT V
SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.

Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army

OCTAVIUS

Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:

You said the enemy would not come down,

But keep the hills and upper regions;

It proves not so: their battles are at hand;

They mean to warn us at Philippi here,

Answering before we do demand of them.


ANTONY

Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know

Wherefore they do it: they could be content

To visit other places; and come down

With fearful bravery, thinking by this face

To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;

But 'tis not so.


Enter a Messenger


Messenger

                  Prepare you, generals:

The enemy comes on in gallant show;

Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,

And something to be done immediately.


ANTONY

Octavius, lead your battle softly on,

Upon the left hand of the even field.


OCTAVIUS

Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.


ANTONY

Why do you cross me in this exigent?


OCTAVIUS

I do not cross you; but I will do so.


March


Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army; LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others


BRUTUS

They stand, and would have parley.


CASSIUS

Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.


OCTAVIUS

Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?


ANTONY

No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.

Make forth; the generals would have some words.


OCTAVIUS

Stir not until the signal.


BRUTUS

Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?


OCTAVIUS

Not that we love words better, as you do.


BRUTUS

Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.


ANTONY

In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:

Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,

Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'


CASSIUS

Antony,

The posture of your blows are yet unknown;

But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,

And leave them honeyless.


ANTONY

Not stingless too.


BRUTUS

O, yes, and soundless too;

For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,

And very wisely threat before you sting.


ANTONY

Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers

Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:

You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,

And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;

Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind

Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!


CASSIUS

Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:

This tongue had not offended so to-day,

If Cassius might have ruled.


OCTAVIUS

Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,

The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;

I draw a sword against conspirators;

When think you that the sword goes up again?

Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds

Be well avenged; or till another Caesar

Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.


BRUTUS

Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,

Unless thou bring'st them with thee.


OCTAVIUS

So I hope;

I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.


BRUTUS

O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,

Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.


CASSIUS

A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,

Join'd with a masker and a reveller!


ANTONY

Old Cassius still!


OCTAVIUS

                  Come, Antony, away!

Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:

If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;

If not, when you have stomachs.


Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army


CASSIUS

Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!

The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.


BRUTUS

Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.


LUCILIUS

[Standing forth]	My lord?


BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart


CASSIUS

Messala!


MESSALA

[Standing forth]  What says my general?


CASSIUS

Messala,

This is my birth-day; as this very day

Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:

Be thou my witness that against my will,

As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set

Upon one battle all our liberties.

You know that I held Epicurus strong

And his opinion: now I change my mind,

And partly credit things that do presage.

Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign

Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,

Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;

Who to Philippi here consorted us:

This morning are they fled away and gone;

And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,

Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,

As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem

A canopy most fatal, under which

Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.


MESSALA

Believe not so.


CASSIUS

                  I but believe it partly;

For I am fresh of spirit and resolved

To meet all perils very constantly.


BRUTUS

Even so, Lucilius.


CASSIUS

                  Now, most noble Brutus,

The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,

Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!

But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,

Let's reason with the worst that may befall.

If we do lose this battle, then is this

The very last time we shall speak together:

What are you then determined to do?


BRUTUS

Even by the rule of that philosophy

By which I did blame Cato for the death

Which he did give himself, I know not how,

But I do find it cowardly and vile,

For fear of what might fall, so to prevent

The time of life: arming myself with patience

To stay the providence of some high powers

That govern us below.


CASSIUS

Then, if we lose this battle,

You are contented to be led in triumph

Thorough the streets of Rome?


BRUTUS

No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,

That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;

He bears too great a mind. But this same day

Must end that work the ides of March begun;

And whether we shall meet again I know not.

Therefore our everlasting farewell take:

For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!

If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;

If not, why then, this parting was well made.


CASSIUS

For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!

If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;

If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.


BRUTUS

Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know

The end of this day's business ere it come!

But it sufficeth that the day will end,

And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!


Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. The field of battle.

Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA

BRUTUS

Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills

Unto the legions on the other side.


Loud alarum

Let them set on at once; for I perceive

But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,

And sudden push gives them the overthrow.

Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.


Exeunt

SCENE III. Another part of the field.

Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS

CASSIUS

O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!

Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:

This ensign here of mine was turning back;

I slew the coward, and did take it from him.


TITINIUS

O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;

Who, having some advantage on Octavius,

Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,

Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.


Enter PINDARUS


PINDARUS

Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;

Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord

Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.


CASSIUS

This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;

Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?


TITINIUS

They are, my lord.


CASSIUS

                  Titinius, if thou lovest me,

Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,

Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,

And here again; that I may rest assured

Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.


TITINIUS

I will be here again, even with a thought.


Exit


CASSIUS

Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;

My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,

And tell me what thou notest about the field.


PINDARUS ascends the hill

This day I breathed first: time is come round,

And where I did begin, there shall I end;

My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?


PINDARUS

[Above]  O my lord!


CASSIUS

What news?


PINDARUS

[Above]  Titinius is enclosed round about

With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;

Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.

Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.

He's ta'en.


Shout

And, hark! they shout for joy.


CASSIUS

Come down, behold no more.

O, coward that I am, to live so long,

To see my best friend ta'en before my face!


PINDARUS descends

Come hither, sirrah:

In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;

And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,

That whatsoever I did bid thee do,

Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;

Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,

That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.

Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;

And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,

Guide thou the sword.


PINDARUS stabs him

Caesar, thou art revenged,

Even with the sword that kill'd thee.


Dies


PINDARUS

So, I am free; yet would not so have been,

Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,

Far from this country Pindarus shall run,

Where never Roman shall take note of him.


Exit


Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA


MESSALA

It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius

Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,

As Cassius' legions are by Antony.


TITINIUS

These tidings will well comfort Cassius.


MESSALA

Where did you leave him?


TITINIUS

All disconsolate,

With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.


MESSALA

Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground?


TITINIUS

He lies not like the living. O my heart!


MESSALA

Is not that he?


TITINIUS

                  No, this was he, Messala,

But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,

As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,

So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;

The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;

Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!

Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.


MESSALA

Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.

O hateful error, melancholy's child,

Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men

The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,

Thou never comest unto a happy birth,

But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!


TITINIUS

What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?


MESSALA

Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet

The noble Brutus, thrusting this report

Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;

For piercing steel and darts envenomed

Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus

As tidings of this sight.


TITINIUS

Hie you, Messala,

And I will seek for Pindarus the while.


Exit MESSALA

Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?

Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they

Put on my brows this wreath of victory,

And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?

Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!

But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;

Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I

Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,

And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.

By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part

Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.


Kills himself


Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO, STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS


BRUTUS

Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?


MESSALA

Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.


BRUTUS

Titinius' face is upward.


CATO

He is slain.


BRUTUS

O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!

Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords

In our own proper entrails.


Low alarums


CATO

Brave Titinius!

Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!


BRUTUS

Are yet two Romans living such as these?

The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!

It is impossible that ever Rome

Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears

To this dead man than you shall see me pay.

I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.

Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:

His funerals shall not be in our camp,

Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;

And come, young Cato; let us to the field.

Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:

'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night

We shall try fortune in a second fight.


Exeunt

SCENE IV. Another part of the field.

Alarum. Enter fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then BRUTUS, CATO, LUCILIUS, and others

BRUTUS

Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!


CATO

What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?

I will proclaim my name about the field:

I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!

A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;

I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!


BRUTUS

And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;

Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!


Exit


LUCILIUS

O young and noble Cato, art thou down?

Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;

And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.


First Soldier

Yield, or thou diest.


LUCILIUS

Only I yield to die:

There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;


Offering money

Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.


First Soldier

We must not. A noble prisoner!


Second Soldier

Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.


First Soldier

I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.


Enter ANTONY

Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.


ANTONY

Where is he?


LUCILIUS

Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:

I dare assure thee that no enemy

Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:

The gods defend him from so great a shame!

When you do find him, or alive or dead,

He will be found like Brutus, like himself.


ANTONY

This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,

A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;

Give him all kindness: I had rather have

Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,

And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;

And bring us word unto Octavius' tent

How every thing is chanced.


Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the field.

Enter BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and VOLUMNIUS

BRUTUS

Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.


CLITUS

Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,

He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.


BRUTUS

Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;

It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.


Whispers


CLITUS

What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.


BRUTUS

Peace then! no words.


CLITUS

I'll rather kill myself.


BRUTUS

Hark thee, Dardanius.


Whispers


DARDANIUS

Shall I do such a deed?


CLITUS

O Dardanius!


DARDANIUS

O Clitus!


CLITUS

What ill request did Brutus make to thee?


DARDANIUS

To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.


CLITUS

Now is that noble vessel full of grief,

That it runs over even at his eyes.


BRUTUS

Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.


VOLUMNIUS

What says my lord?


BRUTUS

                  Why, this, Volumnius:

The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me

Two several times by night; at Sardis once,

And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:

I know my hour is come.


VOLUMNIUS

Not so, my lord.


BRUTUS

Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.

Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;

Our enemies have beat us to the pit:


Low alarums

It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,

Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,

Thou know'st that we two went to school together:

Even for that our love of old, I prithee,

Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.


VOLUMNIUS

That's not an office for a friend, my lord.


Alarum still


CLITUS

Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.


BRUTUS

Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.

Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;

Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,

My heart doth joy that yet in all my life

I found no man but he was true to me.

I shall have glory by this losing day

More than Octavius and Mark Antony

By this vile conquest shall attain unto.

So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue

Hath almost ended his life's history:

Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,

That have but labour'd to attain this hour.


Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'


CLITUS

Fly, my lord, fly.


BRUTUS

                  Hence! I will follow.


Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS

I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:

Thou art a fellow of a good respect;

Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:

Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,

While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?


STRATO

Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.


BRUTUS

Farewell, good Strato.


Runs on his sword

Caesar, now be still:

I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.


Dies


Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA, LUCILIUS, and the army


OCTAVIUS

What man is that?


MESSALA

My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?


STRATO

Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:

The conquerors can but make a fire of him;

For Brutus only overcame himself,

And no man else hath honour by his death.


LUCILIUS

So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,

That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.


OCTAVIUS

All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.

Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?


STRATO

Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.


OCTAVIUS

Do so, good Messala.


MESSALA

How died my master, Strato?


STRATO

I held the sword, and he did run on it.


MESSALA

Octavius, then take him to follow thee,

That did the latest service to my master.


ANTONY

This was the noblest Roman of them all:

All the conspirators save only he

Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;

He only, in a general honest thought

And common good to all, made one of them.

His life was gentle, and the elements

So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up

And say to all the world 'This was a man!'


OCTAVIUS

According to his virtue let us use him,

With all respect and rites of burial.

Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,

Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.

So call the field to rest; and let's away,

To part the glories of this happy day.


Exeunt

ESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant

GLOUCESTER

When shall we come to the top of that same hill?


EDGAR

You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.


GLOUCESTER

Methinks the ground is even.


EDGAR

Horrible steep.

Hark, do you hear the sea?


GLOUCESTER

No, truly.


EDGAR

Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect

By your eyes' anguish.


GLOUCESTER

So may it be, indeed:

Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st

In better phrase and matter than thou didst.


EDGAR

You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed

But in my garments.


GLOUCESTER

Methinks you're better spoken.


EDGAR

Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful

And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!

The crows and choughs that wing the midway air

Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down

Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!

Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:

The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,

Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,

Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy

Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,

That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,

Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;

Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight

Topple down headlong.


GLOUCESTER

Set me where you stand.


EDGAR

Give me your hand: you are now within a foot

Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon

Would I not leap upright.


GLOUCESTER

Let go my hand.

Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel

Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods

Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;

Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.


EDGAR

Now fare you well, good sir.


GLOUCESTER

With all my heart.


EDGAR

Why I do trifle thus with his despair

Is done to cure it.


GLOUCESTER

[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!

This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,

Shake patiently my great affliction off:

If I could bear it longer, and not fall

To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,

My snuff and loathed part of nature should

Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!

Now, fellow, fare thee well.


He falls forward


EDGAR

Gone, sir: farewell.

And yet I know not how conceit may rob

The treasury of life, when life itself

Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,

By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?

Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!

Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.

What are you, sir?


GLOUCESTER

                  Away, and let me die.


EDGAR

Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,

So many fathom down precipitating,

Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;

Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.

Ten masts at each make not the altitude

Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:

Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.


GLOUCESTER

But have I fall'n, or no?


EDGAR

From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.

Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far

Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.


GLOUCESTER

Alack, I have no eyes.

Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,

To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,

When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,

And frustrate his proud will.


EDGAR

Give me your arm:

Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.


GLOUCESTER

Too well, too well.


EDGAR

This is above all strangeness.

Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that

Which parted from you?


GLOUCESTER

A poor unfortunate beggar.


EDGAR

As I stood here below, methought his eyes

Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,

Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:

It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,

Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours

Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.


GLOUCESTER

I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear

Affliction till it do cry out itself

'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,

I took it for a man; often 'twould say

'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.


EDGAR

Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?


Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers

The safer sense will ne'er accommodate

His master thus.


KING LEAR

No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the

king himself.


EDGAR

O thou side-piercing sight!


KING LEAR

Nature's above art in that respect. There's your

press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a

crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,

look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted

cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove

it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well

flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!

Give the word.


EDGAR

Sweet marjoram.


KING LEAR

Pass.


GLOUCESTER

I know that voice.


KING LEAR

Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered

me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my

beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'

and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'

too was no good divinity. When the rain came to

wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when

the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I

found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are

not men o' their words: they told me I was every

thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.


GLOUCESTER

The trick of that voice I do well remember:

Is 't not the king?


KING LEAR

Ay, every inch a king:

When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.

I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?

Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:

The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly

Does lecher in my sight.

Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son

Was kinder to his father than my daughters

Got 'tween the lawful sheets.

To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.

Behold yond simpering dame,

Whose face between her forks presages snow;

That minces virtue, and does shake the head

To hear of pleasure's name;

The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't

With a more riotous appetite.

Down from the waist they are Centaurs,

Though women all above:

But to the girdle do the gods inherit,

Beneath is all the fiends';

There's hell, there's darkness, there's the

sulphurous pit,

Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,

fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,

good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:

there's money for thee.


GLOUCESTER

O, let me kiss that hand!


KING LEAR

Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.


GLOUCESTER

O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world

Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?


KING LEAR

I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny

at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not

love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the

penning of it.


GLOUCESTER

Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.


EDGAR

I would not take this from report; it is,

And my heart breaks at it.


KING LEAR

Read.


GLOUCESTER

What, with the case of eyes?


KING LEAR

O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your

head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in

a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how

this world goes.


GLOUCESTER

I see it feelingly.


KING LEAR

What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes

with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond

justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in

thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which

is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen

a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?


GLOUCESTER

Ay, sir.


KING LEAR

And the creature run from the cur? There thou

mightst behold the great image of authority: a

dog's obeyed in office.

Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!

Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;

Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind

For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.

Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;

Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,

And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:

Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.

None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:

Take that of me, my friend, who have the power

To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;

And like a scurvy politician, seem

To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:

Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.


EDGAR

O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!


KING LEAR

If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.

I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:

Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:

Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,

We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.


GLOUCESTER

Alack, alack the day!


KING LEAR

When we are born, we cry that we are come

To this great stage of fools: this a good block;

It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe

A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;

And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,

Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!


Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants


Gentleman

O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,

Your most dear daughter--


KING LEAR

No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even

The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;

You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;

I am cut to the brains.


Gentleman

You shall have any thing.


KING LEAR

No seconds? all myself?

Why, this would make a man a man of salt,

To use his eyes for garden water-pots,

Ay, and laying autumn's dust.


Gentleman

Good sir,--


KING LEAR

I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!

I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,

My masters, know you that.


Gentleman

You are a royal one, and we obey you.


KING LEAR

Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you

shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.


Exit running; Attendants follow


Gentleman

A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,

Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,

Who redeems nature from the general curse

Which twain have brought her to.


EDGAR

Hail, gentle sir.


Gentleman

                  Sir, speed you: what's your will?


EDGAR

Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?


Gentleman

Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,

Which can distinguish sound.


EDGAR

But, by your favour,

How near's the other army?


Gentleman

Near and on speedy foot; the main descry

Stands on the hourly thought.


EDGAR

I thank you, sir: that's all.


Gentleman

Though that the queen on special cause is here,

Her army is moved on.


EDGAR

I thank you, sir.


Exit Gentleman


GLOUCESTER

You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:

Let not my worser spirit tempt me again

To die before you please!


EDGAR

Well pray you, father.


GLOUCESTER

Now, good sir, what are you?


EDGAR

A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;

Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,

Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,

I'll lead you to some biding.


GLOUCESTER

Hearty thanks:

The bounty and the benison of heaven

To boot, and boot!


Enter OSWALD


OSWALD

A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!

That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh

To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,

Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out

That must destroy thee.


GLOUCESTER

Now let thy friendly hand

Put strength enough to't.


EDGAR interposes


OSWALD

Wherefore, bold peasant,

Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;

Lest that the infection of his fortune take

Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.


EDGAR

Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.


OSWALD

Let go, slave, or thou diest!


EDGAR

Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk

pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,

'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.

Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor

ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be

the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.


OSWALD

Out, dunghill!


EDGAR

Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter vor

your foins.


They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down


OSWALD

Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:

If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;

And give the letters which thou find'st about me

To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out

Upon the British party: O, untimely death!


Dies


EDGAR

I know thee well: a serviceable villain;

As duteous to the vices of thy mistress

As badness would desire.


GLOUCESTER

What, is he dead?


EDGAR

Sit you down, father; rest you

Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of

May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry

He had no other death's-man. Let us see:

Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:

To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;

Their papers, is more lawful.


Reads

'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have

many opportunities to cut him off: if your will

want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.

There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror:

then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal; from

the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply

the place for your labour.

'Your--wife, so I would say--

'Affectionate servant,

'GONERIL.'

O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!

A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;

And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,

Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified

Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time

With this ungracious paper strike the sight

Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well

That of thy death and business I can tell.


GLOUCESTER

The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,

That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling

Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:

So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,

And woes by wrong imaginations lose

The knowledge of themselves.


EDGAR

Give me your hand:


Drum afar off

Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:

Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.


Exeunt

SCENE VII. A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep,
soft music playing; Gentleman, and others attending.


Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor


CORDELIA

O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,

To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,

And every measure fail me.


KENT

To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.

All my reports go with the modest truth;

Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.


CORDELIA

Be better suited:

These weeds are memories of those worser hours:

I prithee, put them off.


KENT

Pardon me, dear madam;

Yet to be known shortens my made intent:

My boon I make it, that you know me not

Till time and I think meet.


CORDELIA

Then be't so, my good lord.


To the Doctor

How does the king?


Doctor

Madam, sleeps still.


CORDELIA

O you kind gods,

Cure this great breach in his abused nature!

The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up

Of this child-changed father!


Doctor

So please your majesty

That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.


CORDELIA

Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed

I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?


Gentleman

Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep

We put fresh garments on him.


Doctor

Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;

I doubt not of his temperance.


CORDELIA

Very well.


Doctor

Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!


CORDELIA

O my dear father! Restoration hang

Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss

Repair those violent harms that my two sisters

Have in thy reverence made!


KENT

Kind and dear princess!


CORDELIA

Had you not been their father, these white flakes

Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face

To be opposed against the warring winds?

To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?

In the most terrible and nimble stroke

Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--

With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,

Though he had bit me, should have stood that night

Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,

To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,

In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!

'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once

Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.


Doctor

Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.


CORDELIA

How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?


KING LEAR

You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:

Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound

Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears

Do scald like moulten lead.


CORDELIA

Sir, do you know me?


KING LEAR

You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?


CORDELIA

Still, still, far wide!


Doctor

He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.


KING LEAR

Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?

I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,

To see another thus. I know not what to say.

I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;

I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured

Of my condition!


CORDELIA

                  O, look upon me, sir,

And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:

No, sir, you must not kneel.


KING LEAR

Pray, do not mock me:

I am a very foolish fond old man,

Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;

And, to deal plainly,

I fear I am not in my perfect mind.

Methinks I should know you, and know this man;

Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant

What place this is; and all the skill I have

Remembers not these garments; nor I know not

Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;

For, as I am a man, I think this lady

To be my child Cordelia.


CORDELIA

And so I am, I am.


KING LEAR

Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:

If you have poison for me, I will drink it.

I know you do not love me; for your sisters

Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:

You have some cause, they have not.


CORDELIA

No cause, no cause.


KING LEAR

Am I in France?


KENT

                  In your own kingdom, sir.


KING LEAR

Do not abuse me.


Doctor

Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,

You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger

To make him even o'er the time he has lost.

Desire him to go in; trouble him no more

Till further settling.


CORDELIA

Will't please your highness walk?


KING LEAR

You must bear with me:

Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.


Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman


Gentleman

Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?


KENT

Most certain, sir.


Gentleman

Who is conductor of his people?


KENT

As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.


Gentleman

They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl

of Kent in Germany.


KENT

Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the

powers of the kingdom approach apace.


Gentleman

The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you

well, sir.


Exit


KENT

My point and period will be throughly wrought,

Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.


Exit


ACT V
SCENE I. The British camp, near Dover.

Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN, Gentlemen, and Soldiers.

EDMUND

Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,

Or whether since he is advised by aught

To change the course: he's full of alteration

And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.


To a Gentleman, who goes out


REGAN

Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.


EDMUND

'Tis to be doubted, madam.


REGAN

Now, sweet lord,

You know the goodness I intend upon you:

Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,

Do you not love my sister?


EDMUND

In honour'd love.


REGAN

But have you never found my brother's way

To the forfended place?


EDMUND

That thought abuses you.


REGAN

I am doubtful that you have been conjunct

And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.


EDMUND

No, by mine honour, madam.


REGAN

I never shall endure her: dear my lord,

Be not familiar with her.


EDMUND

Fear me not:

She and the duke her husband!


Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers


GONERIL

[Aside]  I had rather lose the battle than that sister

Should loosen him and me.


ALBANY

Our very loving sister, well be-met.

Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,

With others whom the rigor of our state

Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,

I never yet was valiant: for this business,

It toucheth us, as France invades our land,

Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,

Most just and heavy causes make oppose.


EDMUND

Sir, you speak nobly.


REGAN

Why is this reason'd?


GONERIL

Combine together 'gainst the enemy;

For these domestic and particular broils

Are not the question here.


ALBANY

Let's then determine

With the ancient of war on our proceedings.


EDMUND

I shall attend you presently at your tent.


REGAN

Sister, you'll go with us?


GONERIL

No.


REGAN

'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.


GONERIL

[Aside]  O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.


As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised


EDGAR

If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,

Hear me one word.


ALBANY

                  I'll overtake you. Speak.


Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR


EDGAR

Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.

If you have victory, let the trumpet sound

For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,

I can produce a champion that will prove

What is avouched there. If you miscarry,

Your business of the world hath so an end,

And machination ceases. Fortune love you.


ALBANY

Stay till I have read the letter.


EDGAR

I was forbid it.

When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,

And I'll appear again.


ALBANY

Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.


Exit EDGAR


Re-enter EDMUND


EDMUND

The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.

Here is the guess of their true strength and forces

By diligent discovery; but your haste

Is now urged on you.


ALBANY

We will greet the time.


Exit


EDMUND

To both these sisters have I sworn my love;

Each jealous of the other, as the stung

Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?

Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,

If both remain alive: to take the widow

Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;

And hardly shall I carry out my side,

Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use

His countenance for the battle; which being done,

Let her who would be rid of him devise

His speedy taking off. As for the mercy

Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,

The battle done, and they within our power,

Shall never see his pardon; for my state

Stands on me to defend, not to debate.


Exit

SCENE II. A field between the two camps.

Alarum within. Enter, with drum and colours,  KING LEAR, CORDELIA, and Soldiers, over the stage; and exeunt

Enter EDGAR and GLOUCESTER

EDGAR

Here, father, take the shadow of this tree

For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:

If ever I return to you again,

I'll bring you comfort.


GLOUCESTER

Grace go with you, sir!


Exit EDGAR


Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter EDGAR


EDGAR

Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!

King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:

Give me thy hand; come on.


GLOUCESTER

No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.


EDGAR

What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure

Their going hence, even as their coming hither;

Ripeness is all: come on.


GLOUCESTER

And that's true too.


Exeunt

SCENE III. The British camp near Dover.

Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, EDMUND,  KING LEAR and CORDELIA, prisoners; Captain, Soldiers,  & c

EDMUND

Some officers take them away: good guard,

Until their greater pleasures first be known

That are to censure them.


CORDELIA

We are not the first

Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.

For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;

Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.

Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?


KING LEAR

No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:

We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:

When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,

And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,

And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh

At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues

Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,

Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;

And take upon's the mystery of things,

As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,

In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,

That ebb and flow by the moon.


EDMUND

Take them away.


KING LEAR

Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,

The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?

He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,

And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;

The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,

Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve

first. Come.


Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded


EDMUND

Come hither, captain; hark.

Take thou this note;


Giving a paper

go follow them to prison:

One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost

As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way

To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men

Are as the time is: to be tender-minded

Does not become a sword: thy great employment

Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,

Or thrive by other means.


Captain

I'll do 't, my lord.


EDMUND

About it; and write happy when thou hast done.

Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so

As I have set it down.


Captain

I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;

If it be man's work, I'll do 't.


Exit


Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another Captain, and Soldiers


ALBANY

Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,

And fortune led you well: you have the captives

That were the opposites of this day's strife:

We do require them of you, so to use them

As we shall find their merits and our safety

May equally determine.


EDMUND

Sir, I thought it fit

To send the old and miserable king

To some retention and appointed guard;

Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,

To pluck the common bosom on his side,

An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes

Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;

My reason all the same; and they are ready

To-morrow, or at further space, to appear

Where you shall hold your session. At this time

We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;

And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed

By those that feel their sharpness:

The question of Cordelia and her father

Requires a fitter place.


ALBANY

Sir, by your patience,

I hold you but a subject of this war,

Not as a brother.


REGAN

                  That's as we list to grace him.

Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,

Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;

Bore the commission of my place and person;

The which immediacy may well stand up,

And call itself your brother.


GONERIL

Not so hot:

In his own grace he doth exalt himself,

More than in your addition.


REGAN

In my rights,

By me invested, he compeers the best.


GONERIL

That were the most, if he should husband you.


REGAN

Jesters do oft prove prophets.


GONERIL

Holla, holla!

That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.


REGAN

Lady, I am not well; else I should answer

From a full-flowing stomach. General,

Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;

Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:

Witness the world, that I create thee here

My lord and master.


GONERIL

Mean you to enjoy him?


ALBANY

The let-alone lies not in your good will.


EDMUND

Nor in thine, lord.


ALBANY

Half-blooded fellow, yes.


REGAN

[To EDMUND]  Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.


ALBANY

Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee

On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,

This gilded serpent


Pointing to Goneril

For your claim, fair sister,

I bar it in the interest of my wife:

'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,

And I, her husband, contradict your bans.

If you will marry, make your loves to me,

My lady is bespoke.


GONERIL

An interlude!


ALBANY

Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:

If none appear to prove upon thy head

Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,

There is my pledge;


Throwing down a glove

I'll prove it on thy heart,

Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less

Than I have here proclaim'd thee.


REGAN

Sick, O, sick!


GONERIL

[Aside]  If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.


EDMUND

There's my exchange:


Throwing down a glove

what in the world he is

That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:

Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,

On him, on you, who not? I will maintain

My truth and honour firmly.


ALBANY

A herald, ho!


EDMUND

                  A herald, ho, a herald!


ALBANY

Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,

All levied in my name, have in my name

Took their discharge.


REGAN

My sickness grows upon me.


ALBANY

She is not well; convey her to  my tent.


Exit Regan, led


Enter a Herald

Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,

And read out this.


Captain

Sound, trumpet!


A trumpet sounds


Herald

[Reads]  'If any man of quality or degree within

the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,

supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold

traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the

trumpet: he is bold in his defence.'


EDMUND

Sound!


First trumpet


Herald

Again!


Second trumpet


Herald

Again!


Third trumpet


Trumpet answers within


Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a trumpet before him


ALBANY

Ask him his purposes, why he appears

Upon this call o' the trumpet.


Herald

What are you?

Your name, your quality? and why you answer

This present summons?


EDGAR

Know, my name is lost;

By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:

Yet am I noble as the adversary

I come to cope.


ALBANY

                  Which is that adversary?


EDGAR

What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?


EDMUND

Himself: what say'st thou to him?


EDGAR

Draw thy sword,

That, if my speech offend a noble heart,

Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.

Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,

My oath, and my profession: I protest,

Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,

Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,

Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;

False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;

Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;

And, from the extremest upward of thy head

To the descent and dust below thy foot,

A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'

This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent

To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,

Thou liest.


EDMUND

In wisdom I should ask thy name;

But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,

And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,

What safe and nicely I might well delay

By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:

Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;

With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;

Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,

This sword of mine shall give them instant way,

Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!


Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls


ALBANY

Save him, save him!


GONERIL

This is practise, Gloucester:

By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer

An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,

But cozen'd and beguiled.


ALBANY

Shut your mouth, dame,

Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:

Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:

No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.


Gives the letter to EDMUND


GONERIL

Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:

Who can arraign me for't.


ALBANY

Most monstrous! oh!

Know'st thou this paper?


GONERIL

Ask me not what I know.


Exit


ALBANY

Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.


EDMUND

What you have charged me with, that have I done;

And more, much more; the time will bring it out:

'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou

That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,

I do forgive thee.


EDGAR

                  Let's exchange charity.

I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;

If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.

My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.

The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices

Make instruments to plague us:

The dark and vicious place where thee he got

Cost him his eyes.


EDMUND

                  Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;

The wheel is come full circle: I am here.


ALBANY

Methought thy very gait did prophesy

A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:

Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I

Did hate thee or thy father!


EDGAR

Worthy prince, I know't.


ALBANY

Where have you hid yourself?

How have you known the miseries of your father?


EDGAR

By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;

And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!

The bloody proclamation to escape,

That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!

That we the pain of death would hourly die

Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift

Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance

That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit

Met I my father with his bleeding rings,

Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,

Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;

Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,

Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:

Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,

I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last

Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,

Alack, too weak the conflict to support!

'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,

Burst smilingly.


EDMUND

This speech of yours hath moved me,

And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;

You look as you had something more to say.


ALBANY

If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;

For I am almost ready to dissolve,

Hearing of this.


EDGAR

                  This would have seem'd a period

To such as love not sorrow; but another,

To amplify too much, would make much more,

And top extremity.

Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,

Who, having seen me in my worst estate,

Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding

Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms

He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out

As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;

Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him

That ever ear received: which in recounting

His grief grew puissant and the strings of life

Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,

And there I left him tranced.


ALBANY

But who was this?


EDGAR

Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise

Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service

Improper for a slave.


Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife


Gentleman

Help, help, O, help!


EDGAR

What kind of help?


ALBANY

Speak, man.


EDGAR

What means that bloody knife?


Gentleman

'Tis hot, it smokes;

It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!


ALBANY

Who dead? speak, man.


Gentleman

Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister

By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.


EDMUND

I was contracted to them both: all three

Now marry in an instant.


EDGAR

Here comes Kent.


ALBANY

Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:

This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,

Touches us not with pity.


Exit Gentleman


Enter KENT

O, is this he?

The time will not allow the compliment

Which very manners urges.


KENT

I am come

To bid my king and master aye good night:

Is he not here?


ALBANY

                  Great thing of us forgot!

Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?

See'st thou this object, Kent?


The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in


KENT

Alack, why thus?


EDMUND

                  Yet Edmund was beloved:

The one the other poison'd for my sake,

And after slew herself.


ALBANY

Even so. Cover their faces.


EDMUND

I pant for life: some good I mean to do,

Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,

Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ

Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:

Nay, send in time.


ALBANY

                  Run, run, O, run!


EDGAR

To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send

Thy token of reprieve.


EDMUND

Well thought on: take my sword,

Give it the captain.


ALBANY

Haste thee, for thy life.


Exit EDGAR


EDMUND

He hath commission from thy wife and me

To hang Cordelia in the prison, and

To lay the blame upon her own despair,

That she fordid herself.


ALBANY

The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.


EDMUND is borne off


Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms; EDGAR, Captain, and others following


KING LEAR

Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:

Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so

That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!

I know when one is dead, and when one lives;

She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;

If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,

Why, then she lives.


KENT

Is this the promised end


EDGAR

Or image of that horror?


ALBANY

Fall, and cease!


KING LEAR

This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,

It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows

That ever I have felt.


KENT

[Kneeling]  O my good master!


KING LEAR

Prithee, away.


EDGAR

'Tis noble Kent, your friend.


KING LEAR

A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!

I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!

Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!

What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,

Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.

I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.


Captain

'Tis true, my lords, he did.


KING LEAR

Did I not, fellow?

I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion

I would have made them skip: I am old now,

And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?

Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.


KENT

If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,

One of them we behold.


KING LEAR

This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?


KENT

The same,

Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?


KING LEAR

He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;

He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.


KENT

No, my good lord; I am the very man,--


KING LEAR

I'll see that straight.


KENT

That, from your first of difference and decay,

Have follow'd your sad steps.


KING LEAR

You are welcome hither.


KENT

Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.

Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,

And desperately are dead.


KING LEAR

Ay, so I think.


ALBANY

He knows not what he says: and vain it is

That we present us to him.


EDGAR

Very bootless.


Enter a Captain


Captain

Edmund is dead, my lord.


ALBANY

That's but a trifle here.

You lords and noble friends, know our intent.

What comfort to this great decay may come

Shall be applied: for us we will resign,

During the life of this old majesty,

To him our absolute power:


To EDGAR and KENT

you, to your rights:

With boot, and such addition as your honours

Have more than merited. All friends shall taste

The wages of their virtue, and all foes

The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!


KING LEAR

And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!

Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,

And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,

Never, never, never, never, never!

Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.

Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,

Look there, look there!


Dies


EDGAR

He faints! My lord, my lord!


KENT

Break, heart; I prithee, break!


EDGAR

Look up, my lord.


KENT

Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much

That would upon the rack of this tough world

Stretch him out longer.


EDGAR

He is gone, indeed.


KENT

The wonder is, he hath endured so long:

He but usurp'd his life.


ALBANY

Bear them from hence. Our present business

Is general woe.


To KENT and EDGAR

Friends of my soul, you twain

Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.


KENT

I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;

My master calls me, I must not say no.


ALBANY

The weight of this sad time we must obey;

Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.

The oldest hath borne most: we that are young

Shall never see so much, nor live so long.


Exeunt, with a dead march
