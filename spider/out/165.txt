Julius Caesar: Entire Play





ACT I

SCENE I. Rome. A street.



Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners



FLAVIUS



Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:


Is this a holiday? what! know you not,


Being mechanical, you ought not walk


Upon a labouring day without the sign


Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?




First Commoner



Why, sir, a carpenter.




MARULLUS



Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?


What dost thou with thy best apparel on?


You, sir, what trade are you?




Second Commoner



Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,


as you would say, a cobbler.




MARULLUS



But what trade art thou? answer me directly.




Second Commoner



A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe


conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.




MARULLUS



What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?




Second Commoner



Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,


if you be out, sir, I can mend you.




MARULLUS



What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!




Second Commoner



Why, sir, cobble you.




FLAVIUS



Thou art a cobbler, art thou?




Second Commoner



Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I


meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's


matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon


to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I


recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon


neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.




FLAVIUS



But wherefore art not in thy shop today?


Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?




Second Commoner



Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself


into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,


to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.




MARULLUS



Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?


What tributaries follow him to Rome,


To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?


You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!


O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,


Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft


Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,


To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,


Your infants in your arms, and there have sat


The livelong day, with patient expectation,


To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:


And when you saw his chariot but appear,


Have you not made an universal shout,


That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,


To hear the replication of your sounds


Made in her concave shores?


And do you now put on your best attire?


And do you now cull out a holiday?


And do you now strew flowers in his way


That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!


Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,


Pray to the gods to intermit the plague


That needs must light on this ingratitude.




FLAVIUS



Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,


Assemble all the poor men of your sort;


Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears


Into the channel, till the lowest stream


Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.



Exeunt all the Commoners


See whether their basest metal be not moved;


They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.


Go you down that way towards the Capitol;




This way will I



disrobe the images,


If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.




MARULLUS



May we do so?


You know it is the feast of Lupercal.




FLAVIUS



It is no matter; let no images


Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,


And drive away the vulgar from the streets:


So do you too, where you perceive them thick.


These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing


Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,


Who else would soar above the view of men


And keep us all in servile fearfulness.



Exeunt



SCENE II. A public place.



Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer



CAESAR



Calpurnia!




CASCA



Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.




CAESAR



Calpurnia!




CALPURNIA



Here, my lord.




CAESAR



Stand you directly in Antonius' way,


When he doth run his course. Antonius!




ANTONY



Caesar, my lord?




CAESAR



Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,


To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,


The barren, touched in this holy chase,


Shake off their sterile curse.




ANTONY



I shall remember:


When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.




CAESAR



Set on; and leave no ceremony out.



Flourish




Soothsayer



Caesar!




CAESAR



Ha! who calls?




CASCA



Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!




CAESAR



Who is it in the press that calls on me?


I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,


Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.




Soothsayer



Beware the ides of March.




CAESAR



What man is that?




BRUTUS



A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.




CAESAR



Set him before me; let me see his face.




CASSIUS



Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.




CAESAR



What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.




Soothsayer



Beware the ides of March.




CAESAR



He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.



Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS




CASSIUS



Will you go see the order of the course?




BRUTUS



Not I.




CASSIUS



I pray you, do.




BRUTUS



I am not gamesome: I do lack some part


Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.


Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;


I'll leave you.




CASSIUS



Brutus, I do observe you now of late:


I have not from your eyes that gentleness


And show of love as I was wont to have:


You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand


Over your friend that loves you.




BRUTUS



Cassius,


Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,


I turn the trouble of my countenance


Merely upon myself. Vexed I am


Of late with passions of some difference,


Conceptions only proper to myself,


Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;


But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--


Among which number, Cassius, be you one--


Nor construe any further my neglect,


Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,


Forgets the shows of love to other men.




CASSIUS



Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;


By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried


Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.


Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?




BRUTUS



No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,


But by reflection, by some other things.




CASSIUS



'Tis just:


And it is very much lamented, Brutus,


That you have no such mirrors as will turn


Your hidden worthiness into your eye,


That you might see your shadow. I have heard,


Where many of the best respect in Rome,


Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus


And groaning underneath this age's yoke,


Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.




BRUTUS



Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,


That you would have me seek into myself


For that which is not in me?




CASSIUS



Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:


And since you know you cannot see yourself


So well as by reflection, I, your glass,


Will modestly discover to yourself


That of yourself which you yet know not of.


And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:


Were I a common laugher, or did use


To stale with ordinary oaths my love


To every new protester; if you know


That I do fawn on men and hug them hard


And after scandal them, or if you know


That I profess myself in banqueting


To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.



Flourish, and shout




BRUTUS



What means this shouting? I do fear, the people


Choose Caesar for their king.




CASSIUS



Ay, do you fear it?


Then must I think you would not have it so.




BRUTUS



I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.


But wherefore do you hold me here so long?


What is it that you would impart to me?


If it be aught toward the general good,


Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,


And I will look on both indifferently,


For let the gods so speed me as I love


The name of honour more than I fear death.




CASSIUS



I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,


As well as I do know your outward favour.


Well, honour is the subject of my story.


I cannot tell what you and other men


Think of this life; but, for my single self,


I had as lief not be as live to be


In awe of such a thing as I myself.


I was born free as Caesar; so were you:


We both have fed as well, and we can both


Endure the winter's cold as well as he:


For once, upon a raw and gusty day,


The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,


Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now


Leap in with me into this angry flood,


And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,


Accoutred as I was, I plunged in


And bade him follow; so indeed he did.


The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it


With lusty sinews, throwing it aside


And stemming it with hearts of controversy;


But ere we could arrive the point proposed,


Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'


I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,


Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder


The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber


Did I the tired Caesar. And this man


Is now become a god, and Cassius is


A wretched creature and must bend his body,


If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.


He had a fever when he was in Spain,


And when the fit was on him, I did mark


How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;


His coward lips did from their colour fly,


And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world


Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:


Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans


Mark him and write his speeches in their books,


Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'


As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me


A man of such a feeble temper should


So get the start of the majestic world


And bear the palm alone.



Shout. Flourish




BRUTUS



Another general shout!


I do believe that these applauses are


For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.




CASSIUS



Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world


Like a Colossus, and we petty men


Walk under his huge legs and peep about


To find ourselves dishonourable graves.


Men at some time are masters of their fates:


The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,


But in ourselves, that we are underlings.


Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?


Why should that name be sounded more than yours?


Write them together, yours is as fair a name;


Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;


Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,


Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.


Now, in the names of all the gods at once,


Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,


That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!


Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!


When went there by an age, since the great flood,


But it was famed with more than with one man?


When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,


That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?


Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,


When there is in it but one only man.


O, you and I have heard our fathers say,


There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd


The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome


As easily as a king.




BRUTUS



That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;


What you would work me to, I have some aim:


How I have thought of this and of these times,


I shall recount hereafter; for this present,


I would not, so with love I might entreat you,


Be any further moved. What you have said


I will consider; what you have to say


I will with patience hear, and find a time


Both meet to hear and answer such high things.


Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:


Brutus had rather be a villager


Than to repute himself a son of Rome


Under these hard conditions as this time


Is like to lay upon us.




CASSIUS



I am glad that my weak words


Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.




BRUTUS



The games are done and Caesar is returning.




CASSIUS



As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;


And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you


What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.



Re-enter CAESAR and his Train




BRUTUS



I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,


The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,


And all the rest look like a chidden train:


Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero


Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes


As we have seen him in the Capitol,


Being cross'd in conference by some senators.




CASSIUS



Casca will tell us what the matter is.




CAESAR



Antonius!




ANTONY



Caesar?




CAESAR



Let me have men about me that are fat;


Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:


Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;


He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.




ANTONY



Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;


He is a noble Roman and well given.




CAESAR



Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:


Yet if my name were liable to fear,


I do not know the man I should avoid


So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;


He is a great observer and he looks


Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,


As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;


Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort


As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit


That could be moved to smile at any thing.


Such men as he be never at heart's ease


Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,


And therefore are they very dangerous.


I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd


Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.


Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,


And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.



Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA




CASCA



You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?




BRUTUS



Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,


That Caesar looks so sad.




CASCA



Why, you were with him, were you not?




BRUTUS



I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.




CASCA



Why, there was a crown offered him: and being


offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,


thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.




BRUTUS



What was the second noise for?




CASCA



Why, for that too.




CASSIUS



They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?




CASCA



Why, for that too.




BRUTUS



Was the crown offered him thrice?




CASCA



Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every


time gentler than other, and at every putting-by


mine honest neighbours shouted.




CASSIUS



Who offered him the crown?




CASCA



Why, Antony.




BRUTUS



Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.




CASCA



I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:


it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark


Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown


neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told


you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my


thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he


offered it to him again; then he put it by again:


but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his


fingers off it. And then he offered it the third


time; he put it the third time by: and still as he


refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their


chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps


and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because


Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked


Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and


for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of


opening my lips and receiving the bad air.




CASSIUS



But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?




CASCA



He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at


mouth, and was speechless.




BRUTUS



'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.




CASSIUS



No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,


And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.




CASCA



I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,


Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not


clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and


displeased them, as they use to do the players in


the theatre, I am no true man.




BRUTUS



What said he when he came unto himself?




CASCA



Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the


common herd was glad he refused the crown, he


plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his


throat to cut. An I had been a man of any


occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,


I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so


he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,


If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired


their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three


or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good


soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but


there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had


stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.




BRUTUS



And after that, he came, thus sad, away?




CASCA



Ay.




CASSIUS



Did Cicero say any thing?




CASCA



Ay, he spoke Greek.




CASSIUS



To what effect?




CASCA



Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the


face again: but those that understood him smiled at


one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own


part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more


news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs


off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you


well. There was more foolery yet, if I could


remember it.




CASSIUS



Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?




CASCA



No, I am promised forth.




CASSIUS



Will you dine with me to-morrow?




CASCA



Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner


worth the eating.




CASSIUS



Good: I will expect you.




CASCA



Do so. Farewell, both.



Exit




BRUTUS



What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!


He was quick mettle when he went to school.




CASSIUS



So is he now in execution


Of any bold or noble enterprise,


However he puts on this tardy form.


This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,


Which gives men stomach to digest his words


With better appetite.




BRUTUS



And so it is. For this time I will leave you:


To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,


I will come home to you; or, if you will,


Come home to me, and I will wait for you.




CASSIUS



I will do so: till then, think of the world.



Exit BRUTUS


Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,


Thy honourable metal may be wrought


From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet


That noble minds keep ever with their likes;


For who so firm that cannot be seduced?


Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:


If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,


He should not humour me. I will this night,


In several hands, in at his windows throw,


As if they came from several citizens,


Writings all tending to the great opinion


That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely


Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:


And after this let Caesar seat him sure;


For we will shake him, or worse days endure.



Exit



SCENE III. The same. A street.



Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO



CICERO



Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?


Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?




CASCA



Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth


Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,


I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds


Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen


The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,


To be exalted with the threatening clouds:


But never till to-night, never till now,


Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.


Either there is a civil strife in heaven,


Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,


Incenses them to send destruction.




CICERO



Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?




CASCA



A common slave--you know him well by sight--


Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn


Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,


Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.


Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--


Against the Capitol I met a lion,


Who glared upon me, and went surly by,


Without annoying me: and there were drawn


Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,


Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw


Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.


And yesterday the bird of night did sit


Even at noon-day upon the market-place,


Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies


Do so conjointly meet, let not men say


'These are their reasons; they are natural;'


For, I believe, they are portentous things


Unto the climate that they point upon.




CICERO



Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:


But men may construe things after their fashion,


Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.


Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?




CASCA



He doth; for he did bid Antonius


Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.




CICERO



Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky


Is not to walk in.




CASCA



Farewell, Cicero.



Exit CICERO



Enter CASSIUS




CASSIUS



Who's there?




CASCA



A Roman.




CASSIUS



Casca, by your voice.




CASCA



Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!




CASSIUS



A very pleasing night to honest men.




CASCA



Who ever knew the heavens menace so?




CASSIUS



Those that have known the earth so full of faults.


For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,


Submitting me unto the perilous night,


And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,


Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;


And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open


The breast of heaven, I did present myself


Even in the aim and very flash of it.




CASCA



But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?


It is the part of men to fear and tremble,


When the most mighty gods by tokens send


Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.




CASSIUS



You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life


That should be in a Roman you do want,


Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze


And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,


To see the strange impatience of the heavens:


But if you would consider the true cause


Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,


Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,


Why old men fool and children calculate,


Why all these things change from their ordinance


Their natures and preformed faculties


To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find


That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,


To make them instruments of fear and warning


Unto some monstrous state.


Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man


Most like this dreadful night,


That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars


As doth the lion in the Capitol,


A man no mightier than thyself or me


In personal action, yet prodigious grown


And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.




CASCA



'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?




CASSIUS



Let it be who it is: for Romans now


Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;


But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,


And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;


Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.




CASCA



Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow


Mean to establish Caesar as a king;


And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,


In every place, save here in Italy.




CASSIUS



I know where I will wear this dagger then;


Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:


Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;


Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:


Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,


Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,


Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;


But life, being weary of these worldly bars,


Never lacks power to dismiss itself.


If I know this, know all the world besides,


That part of tyranny that I do bear


I can shake off at pleasure.



Thunder still




CASCA



So can I:


So every bondman in his own hand bears


The power to cancel his captivity.




CASSIUS



And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?


Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,


But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:


He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.


Those that with haste will make a mighty fire


Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,


What rubbish and what offal, when it serves


For the base matter to illuminate


So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,


Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this


Before a willing bondman; then I know


My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,


And dangers are to me indifferent.




CASCA



You speak to Casca, and to such a man


That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:


Be factious for redress of all these griefs,


And I will set this foot of mine as far


As who goes farthest.




CASSIUS



There's a bargain made.


Now know you, Casca, I have moved already


Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans


To undergo with me an enterprise


Of honourable-dangerous consequence;


And I do know, by this, they stay for me


In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,


There is no stir or walking in the streets;


And the complexion of the element


In favour's like the work we have in hand,


Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.




CASCA



Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.




CASSIUS



'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;


He is a friend.



Enter CINNA


Cinna, where haste you so?




CINNA



To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?




CASSIUS



No, it is Casca; one incorporate


To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?




CINNA



I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!


There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.




CASSIUS



Am I not stay'd for? tell me.




CINNA



Yes, you are.


O Cassius, if you could


But win the noble Brutus to our party--




CASSIUS



Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,


And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,


Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this


In at his window; set this up with wax


Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,


Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.


Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?




CINNA



All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone


To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,


And so bestow these papers as you bade me.




CASSIUS



That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.



Exit CINNA


Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day


See Brutus at his house: three parts of him


Is ours already, and the man entire


Upon the next encounter yields him ours.




CASCA



O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:


And that which would appear offence in us,


His countenance, like richest alchemy,


Will change to virtue and to worthiness.




CASSIUS



Him and his worth and our great need of him


You have right well conceited. Let us go,


For it is after midnight; and ere day


We will awake him and be sure of him.



Exeunt




ACT II

SCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.



Enter BRUTUS



BRUTUS



What, Lucius, ho!


I cannot, by the progress of the stars,


Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!


I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.


When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!



Enter LUCIUS




LUCIUS



Call'd you, my lord?




BRUTUS



Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:


When it is lighted, come and call me here.




LUCIUS



I will, my lord.



Exit




BRUTUS



It must be by his death: and for my part,


I know no personal cause to spurn at him,


But for the general. He would be crown'd:


How that might change his nature, there's the question.


It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;


And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--


And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,


That at his will he may do danger with.


The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins


Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,


I have not known when his affections sway'd


More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,


That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,


Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;


But when he once attains the upmost round.


He then unto the ladder turns his back,


Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees


By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.


Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel


Will bear no colour for the thing he is,


Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,


Would run to these and these extremities:


And therefore think him as a serpent's egg


Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,


And kill him in the shell.



Re-enter LUCIUS




LUCIUS



The taper burneth in your closet, sir.


Searching the window for a flint, I found


This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,


It did not lie there when I went to bed.



Gives him the letter




BRUTUS



Get you to bed again; it is not day.


Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?




LUCIUS



I know not, sir.




BRUTUS



Look in the calendar, and bring me word.




LUCIUS



I will, sir.



Exit




BRUTUS



The exhalations whizzing in the air


Give so much light that I may read by them.



Opens the letter and reads


'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.


Shall Rome,  & c. Speak, strike, redress!


Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'


Such instigations have been often dropp'd


Where I have took them up.


'Shall Rome,  & c.' Thus must I piece it out:


Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?


My ancestors did from the streets of Rome


The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.


'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated


To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:


If the redress will follow, thou receivest


Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!



Re-enter LUCIUS




LUCIUS



Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.



Knocking within




BRUTUS



'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.



Exit LUCIUS


Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,


I have not slept.


Between the acting of a dreadful thing


And the first motion, all the interim is


Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:


The Genius and the mortal instruments


Are then in council; and the state of man,


Like to a little kingdom, suffers then


The nature of an insurrection.



Re-enter LUCIUS




LUCIUS



Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,


Who doth desire to see you.




BRUTUS



Is he alone?




LUCIUS



No, sir, there are moe with him.




BRUTUS



Do you know them?




LUCIUS



No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,


And half their faces buried in their cloaks,


That by no means I may discover them


By any mark of favour.




BRUTUS



Let 'em enter.



Exit LUCIUS


They are the faction. O conspiracy,


Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,


When evils are most free? O, then by day


Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough


To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;


Hide it in smiles and affability:


For if thou path, thy native semblance on,


Not Erebus itself were dim enough


To hide thee from prevention.



Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS




CASSIUS



I think we are too bold upon your rest:


Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?




BRUTUS



I have been up this hour, awake all night.


Know I these men that come along with you?




CASSIUS



Yes, every man of them, and no man here


But honours you; and every one doth wish


You had but that opinion of yourself


Which every noble Roman bears of you.


This is Trebonius.




BRUTUS



He is welcome hither.




CASSIUS



This, Decius Brutus.




BRUTUS



He is welcome too.




CASSIUS



This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.




BRUTUS



They are all welcome.


What watchful cares do interpose themselves


Betwixt your eyes and night?




CASSIUS



Shall I entreat a word?



BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper




DECIUS BRUTUS



Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?




CASCA



No.




CINNA



O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines


That fret the clouds are messengers of day.




CASCA



You shall confess that you are both deceived.


Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,


Which is a great way growing on the south,


Weighing the youthful season of the year.


Some two months hence up higher toward the north


He first presents his fire; and the high east


Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.




BRUTUS



Give me your hands all over, one by one.




CASSIUS



And let us swear our resolution.




BRUTUS



No, not an oath: if not the face of men,


The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--


If these be motives weak, break off betimes,


And every man hence to his idle bed;


So let high-sighted tyranny range on,


Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,


As I am sure they do, bear fire enough


To kindle cowards and to steel with valour


The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,


What need we any spur but our own cause,


To prick us to redress? what other bond


Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,


And will not palter? and what other oath


Than honesty to honesty engaged,


That this shall be, or we will fall for it?


Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,


Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls


That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear


Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain


The even virtue of our enterprise,


Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,


To think that or our cause or our performance


Did need an oath; when every drop of blood


That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,


Is guilty of a several bastardy,


If he do break the smallest particle


Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.




CASSIUS



But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?


I think he will stand very strong with us.




CASCA



Let us not leave him out.




CINNA



No, by no means.




METELLUS CIMBER



O, let us have him, for his silver hairs


Will purchase us a good opinion


And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:


It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;


Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,


But all be buried in his gravity.




BRUTUS



O, name him not: let us not break with him;


For he will never follow any thing


That other men begin.




CASSIUS



Then leave him out.




CASCA



Indeed he is not fit.




DECIUS BRUTUS



Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?




CASSIUS



Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,


Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,


Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him


A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,


If he improve them, may well stretch so far


As to annoy us all: which to prevent,


Let Antony and Caesar fall together.




BRUTUS



Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,


To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,


Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;


For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:


Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.


We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;


And in the spirit of men there is no blood:


O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,


And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,


Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,


Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;


Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,


Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:


And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,


Stir up their servants to an act of rage,


And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make


Our purpose necessary and not envious:


Which so appearing to the common eyes,


We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.


And for Mark Antony, think not of him;


For he can do no more than Caesar's arm


When Caesar's head is off.




CASSIUS



Yet I fear him;


For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--




BRUTUS



Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:


If he love Caesar, all that he can do


Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:


And that were much he should; for he is given


To sports, to wildness and much company.




TREBONIUS



There is no fear in him; let him not die;


For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.



Clock strikes




BRUTUS



Peace! count the clock.




CASSIUS



The clock hath stricken three.




TREBONIUS



'Tis time to part.




CASSIUS



But it is doubtful yet,


Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;


For he is superstitious grown of late,


Quite from the main opinion he held once


Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:


It may be, these apparent prodigies,


The unaccustom'd terror of this night,


And the persuasion of his augurers,


May hold him from the Capitol to-day.




DECIUS BRUTUS



Never fear that: if he be so resolved,


I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear


That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,


And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,


Lions with toils and men with flatterers;


But when I tell him he hates flatterers,


He says he does, being then most flattered.


Let me work;


For I can give his humour the true bent,


And I will bring him to the Capitol.




CASSIUS



Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.




BRUTUS



By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?




CINNA



Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.




METELLUS CIMBER



Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,


Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:


I wonder none of you have thought of him.




BRUTUS



Now, good Metellus, go along by him:


He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;


Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.




CASSIUS



The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.


And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember


What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.




BRUTUS



Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;


Let not our looks put on our purposes,


But bear it as our Roman actors do,


With untired spirits and formal constancy:


And so good morrow to you every one.



Exeunt all but BRUTUS


Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;


Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:


Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,


Which busy care draws in the brains of men;


Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.



Enter PORTIA




PORTIA



Brutus, my lord!




BRUTUS



Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?


It is not for your health thus to commit


Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.




PORTIA



Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,


Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,


You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,


Musing and sighing, with your arms across,


And when I ask'd you what the matter was,


You stared upon me with ungentle looks;


I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,


And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;


Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,


But, with an angry wafture of your hand,


Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;


Fearing to strengthen that impatience


Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal


Hoping it was but an effect of humour,


Which sometime hath his hour with every man.


It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,


And could it work so much upon your shape


As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,


I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,


Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.




BRUTUS



I am not well in health, and that is all.




PORTIA



Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,


He would embrace the means to come by it.




BRUTUS



Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.




PORTIA



Is Brutus sick? and is it physical


To walk unbraced and suck up the humours


Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,


And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,


To dare the vile contagion of the night


And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air


To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;


You have some sick offence within your mind,


Which, by the right and virtue of my place,


I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,


I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,


By all your vows of love and that great vow


Which did incorporate and make us one,


That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,


Why you are heavy, and what men to-night


Have had to resort to you: for here have been


Some six or seven, who did hide their faces


Even from darkness.




BRUTUS



Kneel not, gentle Portia.




PORTIA



I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.


Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,


Is it excepted I should know no secrets


That appertain to you? Am I yourself


But, as it were, in sort or limitation,


To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,


And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs


Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,


Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.




BRUTUS



You are my true and honourable wife,


As dear to me as are the ruddy drops


That visit my sad heart




PORTIA



If this were true, then should I know this secret.


I grant I am a woman; but withal


A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:


I grant I am a woman; but withal


A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.


Think you I am no stronger than my sex,


Being so father'd and so husbanded?


Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:


I have made strong proof of my constancy,


Giving myself a voluntary wound


Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.


And not my husband's secrets?




BRUTUS



O ye gods,


Render me worthy of this noble wife!



Knocking within


Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;


And by and by thy bosom shall partake


The secrets of my heart.


All my engagements I will construe to thee,


All the charactery of my sad brows:


Leave me with haste.



Exit PORTIA


Lucius, who's that knocks?



Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS




LUCIUS



He is a sick man that would speak with you.




BRUTUS



Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.


Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?




LIGARIUS



Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.




BRUTUS



O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,


To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!




LIGARIUS



I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand


Any exploit worthy the name of honour.




BRUTUS



Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,


Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.




LIGARIUS



By all the gods that Romans bow before,


I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!


Brave son, derived from honourable loins!


Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up


My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,


And I will strive with things impossible;


Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?




BRUTUS



A piece of work that will make sick men whole.




LIGARIUS



But are not some whole that we must make sick?




BRUTUS



That must we also. What it is, my Caius,


I shall unfold to thee, as we are going


To whom it must be done.




LIGARIUS



Set on your foot,


And with a heart new-fired I follow you,


To do I know not what: but it sufficeth


That Brutus leads me on.




BRUTUS



Follow me, then.



Exeunt



SCENE II. CAESAR's house.



Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gown



CAESAR



Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:


Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,


'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?



Enter a Servant




Servant



My lord?




CAESAR



Go bid the priests do present sacrifice


And bring me their opinions of success.




Servant



I will, my lord.



Exit



Enter CALPURNIA




CALPURNIA



What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?


You shall not stir out of your house to-day.




CAESAR



Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me


Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see


The face of Caesar, they are vanished.




CALPURNIA



Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,


Yet now they fright me. There is one within,


Besides the things that we have heard and seen,


Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.


A lioness hath whelped in the streets;


And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;


Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,


In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,


Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;


The noise of battle hurtled in the air,


Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,


And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.


O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,


And I do fear them.




CAESAR



What can be avoided


Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?


Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions


Are to the world in general as to Caesar.




CALPURNIA



When beggars die, there are no comets seen;


The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.




CAESAR



Cowards die many times before their deaths;


The valiant never taste of death but once.


Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.


It seems to me most strange that men should fear;


Seeing that death, a necessary end,


Will come when it will come.



Re-enter Servant


What say the augurers?




Servant



They would not have you to stir forth to-day.


Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,


They could not find a heart within the beast.




CAESAR



The gods do this in shame of cowardice:


Caesar should be a beast without a heart,


If he should stay at home to-day for fear.


No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well


That Caesar is more dangerous than he:


We are two lions litter'd in one day,


And I the elder and more terrible:


And Caesar shall go forth.




CALPURNIA



Alas, my lord,


Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.


Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear


That keeps you in the house, and not your own.


We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:


And he shall say you are not well to-day:


Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.




CAESAR



Mark Antony shall say I am not well,


And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.



Enter DECIUS BRUTUS


Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.




DECIUS BRUTUS



Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:


I come to fetch you to the senate-house.




CAESAR



And you are come in very happy time,


To bear my greeting to the senators


And tell them that I will not come to-day:


Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:


I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.




CALPURNIA



Say he is sick.




CAESAR



Shall Caesar send a lie?


Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,


To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?


Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.




DECIUS BRUTUS



Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,


Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.




CAESAR



The cause is in my will: I will not come;


That is enough to satisfy the senate.


But for your private satisfaction,


Because I love you, I will let you know:


Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:


She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,


Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,


Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans


Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:


And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,


And evils imminent; and on her knee


Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.




DECIUS BRUTUS



This dream is all amiss interpreted;


It was a vision fair and fortunate:


Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,


In which so many smiling Romans bathed,


Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck


Reviving blood, and that great men shall press


For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.


This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.




CAESAR



And this way have you well expounded it.




DECIUS BRUTUS



I have, when you have heard what I can say:


And know it now: the senate have concluded


To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.


If you shall send them word you will not come,


Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock


Apt to be render'd, for some one to say


'Break up the senate till another time,


When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'


If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper


'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?


Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love


To our proceeding bids me tell you this;


And reason to my love is liable.




CAESAR



How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!


I am ashamed I did yield to them.


Give me my robe, for I will go.



Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA


And look where Publius is come to fetch me.




PUBLIUS



Good morrow, Caesar.




CAESAR



Welcome, Publius.


What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?


Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,


Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy


As that same ague which hath made you lean.


What is 't o'clock?




BRUTUS



Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.




CAESAR



I thank you for your pains and courtesy.



Enter ANTONY


See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,


Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.




ANTONY



So to most noble Caesar.




CAESAR



Bid them prepare within:


I am to blame to be thus waited for.


Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!


I have an hour's talk in store for you;


Remember that you call on me to-day:


Be near me, that I may remember you.




TREBONIUS



Caesar, I will:



Aside


and so near will I be,


That your best friends shall wish I had been further.




CAESAR



Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;


And we, like friends, will straightway go together.




BRUTUS



[Aside]  That every like is not the same, O Caesar,


The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!



Exeunt



SCENE III. A street near the Capitol.



Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paper



ARTEMIDORUS



'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;


come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not


Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus


loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.


There is but one mind in all these men, and it is


bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,


look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.


The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,


'ARTEMIDORUS.'


Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,


And as a suitor will I give him this.


My heart laments that virtue cannot live


Out of the teeth of emulation.


If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;


If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.



Exit



SCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS.



Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS



PORTIA



I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;


Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:


Why dost thou stay?




LUCIUS



To know my errand, madam.




PORTIA



I would have had thee there, and here again,


Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.


O constancy, be strong upon my side,


Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!


I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.


How hard it is for women to keep counsel!


Art thou here yet?




LUCIUS



Madam, what should I do?


Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?


And so return to you, and nothing else?




PORTIA



Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,


For he went sickly forth: and take good note


What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.


Hark, boy! what noise is that?




LUCIUS



I hear none, madam.




PORTIA



Prithee, listen well;


I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,


And the wind brings it from the Capitol.




LUCIUS



Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.



Enter the Soothsayer




PORTIA



Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?




Soothsayer



At mine own house, good lady.




PORTIA



What is't o'clock?




Soothsayer



About the ninth hour, lady.




PORTIA



Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?




Soothsayer



Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,


To see him pass on to the Capitol.




PORTIA



Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?




Soothsayer



That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar


To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,


I shall beseech him to befriend himself.




PORTIA



Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?




Soothsayer



None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.


Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:


The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,


Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,


Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:


I'll get me to a place more void, and there


Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.



Exit




PORTIA



I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing


The heart of woman is! O Brutus,


The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!


Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit


That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.


Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;


Say I am merry: come to me again,


And bring me word what he doth say to thee.



Exeunt severally




ACT III

SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.



A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the  Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, METELLUS CIMBER,  TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS, PUBLIUS, and others



CAESAR



[To the Soothsayer]  The ides of March are come.




Soothsayer



Ay, Caesar; but not gone.




ARTEMIDORUS



Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.




DECIUS BRUTUS



Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,


At your best leisure, this his humble suit.




ARTEMIDORUS



O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit


That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.




CAESAR



What touches us ourself shall be last served.




ARTEMIDORUS



Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.




CAESAR



What, is the fellow mad?




PUBLIUS



Sirrah, give place.




CASSIUS



What, urge you your petitions in the street?


Come to the Capitol.



CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest following




POPILIUS



I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.




CASSIUS



What enterprise, Popilius?




POPILIUS



Fare you well.



Advances to CAESAR




BRUTUS



What said Popilius Lena?




CASSIUS



He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.


I fear our purpose is discovered.




BRUTUS



Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.




CASSIUS



Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.


Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,


Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,


For I will slay myself.




BRUTUS



Cassius, be constant:


Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;


For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.




CASSIUS



Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.


He draws Mark Antony out of the way.



Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS




DECIUS BRUTUS



Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,


And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.




BRUTUS



He is address'd: press near and second him.




CINNA



Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.




CAESAR



Are we all ready? What is now amiss


That Caesar and his senate must redress?




METELLUS CIMBER



Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,


Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat


An humble heart,--



Kneeling




CAESAR



I must prevent thee, Cimber.


These couchings and these lowly courtesies


Might fire the blood of ordinary men,


And turn pre-ordinance and first decree


Into the law of children. Be not fond,


To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood


That will be thaw'd from the true quality


With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,


Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.


Thy brother by decree is banished:


If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,


I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.


Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause


Will he be satisfied.




METELLUS CIMBER



Is there no voice more worthy than my own


To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear


For the repealing of my banish'd brother?




BRUTUS



I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;


Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may


Have an immediate freedom of repeal.




CAESAR



What, Brutus!




CASSIUS



Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:


As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,


To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.




CASSIUS



I could be well moved, if I were as you:


If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:


But I am constant as the northern star,


Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality


There is no fellow in the firmament.


The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,


They are all fire and every one doth shine,


But there's but one in all doth hold his place:


So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,


And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;


Yet in the number I do know but one


That unassailable holds on his rank,


Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,


Let me a little show it, even in this;


That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,


And constant do remain to keep him so.




CINNA



O Caesar,--




CAESAR



Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?




DECIUS BRUTUS



Great Caesar,--




CAESAR



Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?




CASCA



Speak, hands for me!



CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and BRUTUS stab CAESAR




CAESAR



Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.



Dies




CINNA



Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!


Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.




CASSIUS



Some to the common pulpits, and cry out


'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'




BRUTUS



People and senators, be not affrighted;


Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.




CASCA



Go to the pulpit, Brutus.




DECIUS BRUTUS



And Cassius too.




BRUTUS



Where's Publius?




CINNA



Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.




METELLUS CIMBER



Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's


Should chance--




BRUTUS



Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;


There is no harm intended to your person,


Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.




CASSIUS



And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,


Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.




BRUTUS



Do so: and let no man abide this deed,


But we the doers.



Re-enter TREBONIUS




CASSIUS



Where is Antony?




TREBONIUS



Fled to his house amazed:


Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run


As it were doomsday.




BRUTUS



Fates, we will know your pleasures:


That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time


And drawing days out, that men stand upon.




CASSIUS



Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life


Cuts off so many years of fearing death.




BRUTUS



Grant that, and then is death a benefit:


So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged


His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,


And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood


Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:


Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,


And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,


Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'




CASSIUS



Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence


Shall this our lofty scene be acted over


In states unborn and accents yet unknown!




BRUTUS



How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,


That now on Pompey's basis lies along


No worthier than the dust!




CASSIUS



So oft as that shall be,


So often shall the knot of us be call'd


The men that gave their country liberty.




DECIUS BRUTUS



What, shall we forth?




CASSIUS



Ay, every man away:


Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels


With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.



Enter a Servant




BRUTUS



Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.




Servant



Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:


Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;


And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:


Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;


Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:


Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;


Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.


If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony


May safely come to him, and be resolved


How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,


Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead


So well as Brutus living; but will follow


The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus


Thorough the hazards of this untrod state


With all true faith. So says my master Antony.




BRUTUS



Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;


I never thought him worse.


Tell him, so please him come unto this place,


He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,


Depart untouch'd.




Servant



I'll fetch him presently.



Exit




BRUTUS



I know that we shall have him well to friend.




CASSIUS



I wish we may: but yet have I a mind


That fears him much; and my misgiving still


Falls shrewdly to the purpose.




BRUTUS



But here comes Antony.



Re-enter ANTONY


Welcome, Mark Antony.




ANTONY



O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?


Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,


Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.


I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,


Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:


If I myself, there is no hour so fit


As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument


Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich


With the most noble blood of all this world.


I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,


Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,


Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,


I shall not find myself so apt to die:


No place will please me so, no mean of death,


As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,


The choice and master spirits of this age.




BRUTUS



O Antony, beg not your death of us.


Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,


As, by our hands and this our present act,


You see we do, yet see you but our hands


And this the bleeding business they have done:


Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;


And pity to the general wrong of Rome--


As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--


Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,


To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:


Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts


Of brothers' temper, do receive you in


With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.




CASSIUS



Your voice shall be as strong as any man's


In the disposing of new dignities.




BRUTUS



Only be patient till we have appeased


The multitude, beside themselves with fear,


And then we will deliver you the cause,


Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,


Have thus proceeded.




ANTONY



I doubt not of your wisdom.


Let each man render me his bloody hand:


First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;


Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;


Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;


Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;


Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.


Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?


My credit now stands on such slippery ground,


That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,


Either a coward or a flatterer.


That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:


If then thy spirit look upon us now,


Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,


To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,


Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,


Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?


Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,


Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,


It would become me better than to close


In terms of friendship with thine enemies.


Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;


Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,


Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.


O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;


And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.


How like a deer, strucken by many princes,


Dost thou here lie!




CASSIUS



Mark Antony,--




ANTONY



Pardon me, Caius Cassius:


The enemies of Caesar shall say this;


Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.




CASSIUS



I blame you not for praising Caesar so;


But what compact mean you to have with us?


Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;


Or shall we on, and not depend on you?




ANTONY



Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,


Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.


Friends am I with you all and love you all,


Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons


Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.




BRUTUS



Or else were this a savage spectacle:


Our reasons are so full of good regard


That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,


You should be satisfied.




ANTONY



That's all I seek:


And am moreover suitor that I may


Produce his body to the market-place;


And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,


Speak in the order of his funeral.




BRUTUS



You shall, Mark Antony.




CASSIUS



Brutus, a word with you.



Aside to BRUTUS


You know not what you do: do not consent


That Antony speak in his funeral:


Know you how much the people may be moved


By that which he will utter?




BRUTUS



By your pardon;


I will myself into the pulpit first,


And show the reason of our Caesar's death:


What Antony shall speak, I will protest


He speaks by leave and by permission,


And that we are contented Caesar shall


Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.


It shall advantage more than do us wrong.




CASSIUS



I know not what may fall; I like it not.




BRUTUS



Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.


You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,


But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,


And say you do't by our permission;


Else shall you not have any hand at all


About his funeral: and you shall speak


In the same pulpit whereto I am going,


After my speech is ended.




ANTONY



Be it so.


I do desire no more.




BRUTUS



Prepare the body then, and follow us.



Exeunt all but ANTONY




ANTONY



O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,


That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!


Thou art the ruins of the noblest man


That ever lived in the tide of times.


Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!


Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--


Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,


To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--


A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;


Domestic fury and fierce civil strife


Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;


Blood and destruction shall be so in use


And dreadful objects so familiar


That mothers shall but smile when they behold


Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;


All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:


And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,


With Ate by his side come hot from hell,


Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice


Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;


That this foul deed shall smell above the earth


With carrion men, groaning for burial.



Enter a Servant


You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?




Servant



I do, Mark Antony.




ANTONY



Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.




Servant



He did receive his letters, and is coming;


And bid me say to you by word of mouth--


O Caesar!--



Seeing the body




ANTONY



Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.


Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,


Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,


Began to water. Is thy master coming?




Servant



He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.




ANTONY



Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:


Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,


No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;


Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;


Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse


Into the market-place: there shall I try


In my oration, how the people take


The cruel issue of these bloody men;


According to the which, thou shalt discourse


To young Octavius of the state of things.


Lend me your hand.



Exeunt with CAESAR's body



SCENE II. The Forum.



Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens



Citizens



We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.




BRUTUS



Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.


Cassius, go you into the other street,


And part the numbers.


Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;


Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;


And public reasons shall be rendered


Of Caesar's death.




First Citizen



I will hear Brutus speak.




Second Citizen



I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,


When severally we hear them rendered.



Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit




Third Citizen



The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!




BRUTUS



Be patient till the last.


Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my


cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me


for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that


you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and


awake your senses, that you may the better judge.


If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of


Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar


was no less than his. If then that friend demand


why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:


--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved


Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and


die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live


all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;


as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was


valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I


slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his


fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his


ambition. Who is here so base that would be a


bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.


Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If


any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so


vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;


for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.




All



None, Brutus, none.




BRUTUS



Then none have I offended. I have done no more to


Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of


his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not


extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences


enforced, for which he suffered death.



Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body


Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,


though he had no hand in his death, shall receive


the benefit of his dying, a place in the


commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this


I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the


good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,


when it shall please my country to need my death.




All



Live, Brutus! live, live!




First Citizen



Bring him with triumph home unto his house.




Second Citizen



Give him a statue with his ancestors.




Third Citizen



Let him be Caesar.




Fourth Citizen



Caesar's better parts


Shall be crown'd in Brutus.




First Citizen



We'll bring him to his house


With shouts and clamours.




BRUTUS



My countrymen,--




Second Citizen



Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.




First Citizen



Peace, ho!




BRUTUS



Good countrymen, let me depart alone,


And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:


Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech


Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,


By our permission, is allow'd to make.


I do entreat you, not a man depart,


Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.



Exit




First Citizen



Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.




Third Citizen



Let him go up into the public chair;


We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.




ANTONY



For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.



Goes into the pulpit




Fourth Citizen



What does he say of Brutus?




Third Citizen



He says, for Brutus' sake,


He finds himself beholding to us all.




Fourth Citizen



'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.




First Citizen



This Caesar was a tyrant.




Third Citizen



Nay, that's certain:


We are blest that Rome is rid of him.




Second Citizen



Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.




ANTONY



You gentle Romans,--




Citizens



Peace, ho! let us hear him.




ANTONY



Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;


I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.


The evil that men do lives after them;


The good is oft interred with their bones;


So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus


Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:


If it were so, it was a grievous fault,


And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.


Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--


For Brutus is an honourable man;


So are they all, all honourable men--


Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.


He was my friend, faithful and just to me:


But Brutus says he was ambitious;


And Brutus is an honourable man.


He hath brought many captives home to Rome


Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:


Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?


When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:


Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:


Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;


And Brutus is an honourable man.


You all did see that on the Lupercal


I thrice presented him a kingly crown,


Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?


Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;


And, sure, he is an honourable man.


I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,


But here I am to speak what I do know.


You all did love him once, not without cause:


What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?


O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,


And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;


My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,


And I must pause till it come back to me.




First Citizen



Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.




Second Citizen



If thou consider rightly of the matter,


Caesar has had great wrong.




Third Citizen



Has he, masters?


I fear there will a worse come in his place.




Fourth Citizen



Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;


Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.




First Citizen



If it be found so, some will dear abide it.




Second Citizen



Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.




Third Citizen



There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.




Fourth Citizen



Now mark him, he begins again to speak.




ANTONY



But yesterday the word of Caesar might


Have stood against the world; now lies he there.


And none so poor to do him reverence.


O masters, if I were disposed to stir


Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,


I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,


Who, you all know, are honourable men:


I will not do them wrong; I rather choose


To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,


Than I will wrong such honourable men.


But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;


I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:


Let but the commons hear this testament--


Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--


And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds


And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,


Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,


And, dying, mention it within their wills,


Bequeathing it as a rich legacy


Unto their issue.




Fourth Citizen



We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.




All



The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.




ANTONY



Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;


It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.


You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;


And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,


It will inflame you, it will make you mad:


'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;


For, if you should, O, what would come of it!




Fourth Citizen



Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;


You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.




ANTONY



Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?


I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:


I fear I wrong the honourable men


Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.




Fourth Citizen



They were traitors: honourable men!




All



The will! the testament!




Second Citizen



They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.




ANTONY



You will compel me, then, to read the will?


Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,


And let me show you him that made the will.


Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?




Several Citizens



Come down.




Second Citizen



Descend.




Third Citizen



You shall have leave.



ANTONY comes down




Fourth Citizen



A ring; stand round.




First Citizen



Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.




Second Citizen



Room for Antony, most noble Antony.




ANTONY



Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.




Several Citizens



Stand back; room; bear back.




ANTONY



If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.


You all do know this mantle: I remember


The first time ever Caesar put it on;


'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,


That day he overcame the Nervii:


Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:


See what a rent the envious Casca made:


Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;


And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,


Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,


As rushing out of doors, to be resolved


If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;


For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:


Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!


This was the most unkindest cut of all;


For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,


Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,


Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;


And, in his mantle muffling up his face,


Even at the base of Pompey's statua,


Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.


O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!


Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,


Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.


O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel


The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.


Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold


Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,


Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.




First Citizen



O piteous spectacle!




Second Citizen



O noble Caesar!




Third Citizen



O woful day!




Fourth Citizen



O traitors, villains!




First Citizen



O most bloody sight!




Second Citizen



We will be revenged.




All



Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!


Let not a traitor live!




ANTONY



Stay, countrymen.




First Citizen



Peace there! hear the noble Antony.




Second Citizen



We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.




ANTONY



Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up


To such a sudden flood of mutiny.


They that have done this deed are honourable:


What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,


That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,


And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.


I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:


I am no orator, as Brutus is;


But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,


That love my friend; and that they know full well


That gave me public leave to speak of him:


For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,


Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,


To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;


I tell you that which you yourselves do know;


Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,


And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,


And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony


Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue


In every wound of Caesar that should move


The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.




All



We'll mutiny.




First Citizen



We'll burn the house of Brutus.




Third Citizen



Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.




ANTONY



Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.




All



Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!




ANTONY



Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:


Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?


Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:


You have forgot the will I told you of.




All



Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.




ANTONY



Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.


To every Roman citizen he gives,


To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.




Second Citizen



Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.




Third Citizen



O royal Caesar!




ANTONY



Hear me with patience.




All



Peace, ho!




ANTONY



Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,


His private arbours and new-planted orchards,


On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,


And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,


To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.


Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?




First Citizen



Never, never. Come, away, away!


We'll burn his body in the holy place,


And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.


Take up the body.




Second Citizen



Go fetch fire.




Third Citizen



Pluck down benches.




Fourth Citizen



Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.



Exeunt Citizens with the body




ANTONY



Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,


Take thou what course thou wilt!



Enter a Servant


How now, fellow!




Servant



Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.




ANTONY



Where is he?




Servant



He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.




ANTONY



And thither will I straight to visit him:


He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,


And in this mood will give us any thing.




Servant



I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius


Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.




ANTONY



Belike they had some notice of the people,


How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.



Exeunt



SCENE III. A street.



Enter CINNA the poet



CINNA THE POET



I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,


And things unlucky charge my fantasy:


I have no will to wander forth of doors,


Yet something leads me forth.



Enter Citizens




First Citizen



What is your name?




Second Citizen



Whither are you going?




Third Citizen



Where do you dwell?




Fourth Citizen



Are you a married man or a bachelor?




Second Citizen



Answer every man directly.




First Citizen



Ay, and briefly.




Fourth Citizen



Ay, and wisely.




Third Citizen



Ay, and truly, you were best.




CINNA THE POET



What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I


dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to


answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and


truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.




Second Citizen



That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:


you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.




CINNA THE POET



Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.




First Citizen



As a friend or an enemy?




CINNA THE POET



As a friend.




Second Citizen



That matter is answered directly.




Fourth Citizen



For your dwelling,--briefly.




CINNA THE POET



Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.




Third Citizen



Your name, sir, truly.




CINNA THE POET



Truly, my name is Cinna.




First Citizen



Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.




CINNA THE POET



I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.




Fourth Citizen



Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.




CINNA THE POET



I am not Cinna the conspirator.




Fourth Citizen



It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his


name out of his heart, and turn him going.




Third Citizen



Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands:


to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius'


house, and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away, go!



Exeunt




ACT IV

SCENE I. A house in Rome.



ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table



ANTONY



These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.




OCTAVIUS



Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?




LEPIDUS



I do consent--




OCTAVIUS



Prick him down, Antony.




LEPIDUS



Upon condition Publius shall not live,


Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.




ANTONY



He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.


But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;


Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine


How to cut off some charge in legacies.




LEPIDUS



What, shall I find you here?




OCTAVIUS



Or here, or at the Capitol.



Exit LEPIDUS




ANTONY



This is a slight unmeritable man,


Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,


The three-fold world divided, he should stand


One of the three to share it?




OCTAVIUS



So you thought him;


And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,


In our black sentence and proscription.




ANTONY



Octavius, I have seen more days than you:


And though we lay these honours on this man,


To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,


He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,


To groan and sweat under the business,


Either led or driven, as we point the way;


And having brought our treasure where we will,


Then take we down his load, and turn him off,


Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,


And graze in commons.




OCTAVIUS



You may do your will;


But he's a tried and valiant soldier.




ANTONY



So is my horse, Octavius; and for that


I do appoint him store of provender:


It is a creature that I teach to fight,


To wind, to stop, to run directly on,


His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.


And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;


He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;


A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds


On abjects, orts and imitations,


Which, out of use and staled by other men,


Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,


But as a property. And now, Octavius,


Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius


Are levying powers: we must straight make head:


Therefore let our alliance be combined,


Our best friends made, our means stretch'd


And let us presently go sit in council,


How covert matters may be best disclosed,


And open perils surest answered.




OCTAVIUS



Let us do so: for we are at the stake,


And bay'd about with many enemies;


And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,


Millions of mischiefs.



Exeunt



SCENE II. Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.



Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them



BRUTUS



Stand, ho!




LUCILIUS



Give the word, ho! and stand.




BRUTUS



What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?




LUCILIUS



He is at hand; and Pindarus is come


To do you salutation from his master.




BRUTUS



He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,


In his own change, or by ill officers,


Hath given me some worthy cause to wish


Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,


I shall be satisfied.




PINDARUS



I do not doubt


But that my noble master will appear


Such as he is, full of regard and honour.




BRUTUS



He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;


How he received you, let me be resolved.




LUCILIUS



With courtesy and with respect enough;


But not with such familiar instances,


Nor with such free and friendly conference,


As he hath used of old.




BRUTUS



Thou hast described


A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,


When love begins to sicken and decay,


It useth an enforced ceremony.


There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;


But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,


Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;


But when they should endure the bloody spur,


They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,


Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?




LUCILIUS



They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;


The greater part, the horse in general,


Are come with Cassius.




BRUTUS



Hark! he is arrived.



Low march within


March gently on to meet him.



Enter CASSIUS and his powers




CASSIUS



Stand, ho!




BRUTUS



Stand, ho! Speak the word along.




First Soldier



Stand!




Second Soldier



Stand!




Third Soldier



Stand!




CASSIUS



Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.




BRUTUS



Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?


And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?




CASSIUS



Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;


And when you do them--




BRUTUS



Cassius, be content.


Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.


Before the eyes of both our armies here,


Which should perceive nothing but love from us,


Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;


Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,


And I will give you audience.




CASSIUS



Pindarus,


Bid our commanders lead their charges off


A little from this ground.




BRUTUS



Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man


Come to our tent till we have done our conference.


Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.



Exeunt



SCENE III. Brutus's tent.



Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS



CASSIUS



That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:


You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella


For taking bribes here of the Sardians;


Wherein my letters, praying on his side,


Because I knew the man, were slighted off.




BRUTUS



You wronged yourself to write in such a case.




CASSIUS



In such a time as this it is not meet


That every nice offence should bear his comment.




BRUTUS



Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself


Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;


To sell and mart your offices for gold


To undeservers.




CASSIUS



I an itching palm!


You know that you are Brutus that speak this,


Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.




BRUTUS



The name of Cassius honours this corruption,


And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.




CASSIUS



Chastisement!




BRUTUS



Remember March, the ides of March remember:


Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?


What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,


And not for justice? What, shall one of us


That struck the foremost man of all this world


But for supporting robbers, shall we now


Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,


And sell the mighty space of our large honours


For so much trash as may be grasped thus?


I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,


Than such a Roman.




CASSIUS



Brutus, bay not me;


I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,


To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,


Older in practise, abler than yourself


To make conditions.




BRUTUS



Go to; you are not, Cassius.




CASSIUS



I am.




BRUTUS



I say you are not.




CASSIUS



Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;


Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.




BRUTUS



Away, slight man!




CASSIUS



Is't possible?




BRUTUS



Hear me, for I will speak.


Must I give way and room to your rash choler?


Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?




CASSIUS



O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?




BRUTUS



All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;


Go show your slaves how choleric you are,


And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?


Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch


Under your testy humour? By the gods


You shall digest the venom of your spleen,


Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,


I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,


When you are waspish.




CASSIUS



Is it come to this?




BRUTUS



You say you are a better soldier:


Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,


And it shall please me well: for mine own part,


I shall be glad to learn of noble men.




CASSIUS



You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;


I said, an elder soldier, not a better:


Did I say 'better'?




BRUTUS



If you did, I care not.




CASSIUS



When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.




BRUTUS



Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.




CASSIUS



I durst not!




BRUTUS



No.




CASSIUS



What, durst not tempt him!




BRUTUS



For your life you durst not!




CASSIUS



Do not presume too much upon my love;


I may do that I shall be sorry for.




BRUTUS



You have done that you should be sorry for.


There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,


For I am arm'd so strong in honesty


That they pass by me as the idle wind,


Which I respect not. I did send to you


For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:


For I can raise no money by vile means:


By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,


And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring


From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash


By any indirection: I did send


To you for gold to pay my legions,


Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?


Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?


When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,


To lock such rascal counters from his friends,


Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;


Dash him to pieces!




CASSIUS



I denied you not.




BRUTUS



You did.




CASSIUS



I did not: he was but a fool that brought


My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:


A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,


But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.




BRUTUS



I do not, till you practise them on me.




CASSIUS



You love me not.




BRUTUS



I do not like your faults.




CASSIUS



A friendly eye could never see such faults.




BRUTUS



A flatterer's would not, though they do appear


As huge as high Olympus.




CASSIUS



Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,


Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,


For Cassius is aweary of the world;


Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;


Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,


Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,


To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep


My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,


And here my naked breast; within, a heart


Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:


If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;


I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:


Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,


When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better


Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.




BRUTUS



Sheathe your dagger:


Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;


Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.


O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb


That carries anger as the flint bears fire;


Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,


And straight is cold again.




CASSIUS



Hath Cassius lived


To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,


When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?




BRUTUS



When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.




CASSIUS



Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.




BRUTUS



And my heart too.




CASSIUS



O Brutus!




BRUTUS



What's the matter?




CASSIUS



Have not you love enough to bear with me,


When that rash humour which my mother gave me


Makes me forgetful?




BRUTUS



Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,


When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,


He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.




Poet



[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals;


There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet


They be alone.




LUCILIUS



[Within]  You shall not come to them.




Poet



[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.



Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS




CASSIUS



How now! what's the matter?




Poet



For shame, you generals! what do you mean?


Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;


For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.




CASSIUS



Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!




BRUTUS



Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!




CASSIUS



Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.




BRUTUS



I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:


What should the wars do with these jigging fools?


Companion, hence!




CASSIUS



Away, away, be gone.



Exit Poet




BRUTUS



Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders


Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.




CASSIUS



And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you


Immediately to us.



Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS




BRUTUS



Lucius, a bowl of wine!



Exit LUCIUS




CASSIUS



I did not think you could have been so angry.




BRUTUS



O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.




CASSIUS



Of your philosophy you make no use,


If you give place to accidental evils.




BRUTUS



No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.




CASSIUS



Ha! Portia!




BRUTUS



She is dead.




CASSIUS



How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?


O insupportable and touching loss!


Upon what sickness?




BRUTUS



Impatient of my absence,


And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony


Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death


That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,


And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.




CASSIUS



And died so?




BRUTUS



Even so.




CASSIUS



O ye immortal gods!



Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper




BRUTUS



Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.


In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.




CASSIUS



My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.


Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;


I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.




BRUTUS



Come in, Titinius!



Exit LUCIUS



Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA


Welcome, good Messala.


Now sit we close about this taper here,


And call in question our necessities.




CASSIUS



Portia, art thou gone?




BRUTUS



No more, I pray you.


Messala, I have here received letters,


That young Octavius and Mark Antony


Come down upon us with a mighty power,


Bending their expedition toward Philippi.




MESSALA



Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.




BRUTUS



With what addition?




MESSALA



That by proscription and bills of outlawry,


Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,


Have put to death an hundred senators.




BRUTUS



Therein our letters do not well agree;


Mine speak of seventy senators that died


By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.




CASSIUS



Cicero one!




MESSALA



Cicero is dead,


And by that order of proscription.


Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?




BRUTUS



No, Messala.




MESSALA



Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?




BRUTUS



Nothing, Messala.




MESSALA



That, methinks, is strange.




BRUTUS



Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?




MESSALA



No, my lord.




BRUTUS



Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.




MESSALA



Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:


For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.




BRUTUS



Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:


With meditating that she must die once,


I have the patience to endure it now.




MESSALA



Even so great men great losses should endure.




CASSIUS



I have as much of this in art as you,


But yet my nature could not bear it so.




BRUTUS



Well, to our work alive. What do you think


Of marching to Philippi presently?




CASSIUS



I do not think it good.




BRUTUS



Your reason?




CASSIUS



This it is:


'Tis better that the enemy seek us:


So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,


Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,


Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.




BRUTUS



Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.


The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground


Do stand but in a forced affection;


For they have grudged us contribution:


The enemy, marching along by them,


By them shall make a fuller number up,


Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;


From which advantage shall we cut him off,


If at Philippi we do face him there,


These people at our back.




CASSIUS



Hear me, good brother.




BRUTUS



Under your pardon. You must note beside,


That we have tried the utmost of our friends,


Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:


The enemy increaseth every day;


We, at the height, are ready to decline.


There is a tide in the affairs of men,


Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;


Omitted, all the voyage of their life


Is bound in shallows and in miseries.


On such a full sea are we now afloat;


And we must take the current when it serves,


Or lose our ventures.




CASSIUS



Then, with your will, go on;


We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.




BRUTUS



The deep of night is crept upon our talk,


And nature must obey necessity;


Which we will niggard with a little rest.


There is no more to say?




CASSIUS



No more. Good night:


Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.




BRUTUS



Lucius!



Enter LUCIUS


My gown.



Exit LUCIUS


Farewell, good Messala:


Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,


Good night, and good repose.




CASSIUS



O my dear brother!


This was an ill beginning of the night:


Never come such division 'tween our souls!


Let it not, Brutus.




BRUTUS



Every thing is well.




CASSIUS



Good night, my lord.




BRUTUS



Good night, good brother.




TITINIUS



MESSALA



Good night, Lord Brutus.




BRUTUS



Farewell, every one.



Exeunt all but BRUTUS



Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown


Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?




LUCIUS



Here in the tent.




BRUTUS



What, thou speak'st drowsily?


Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.


Call Claudius and some other of my men:


I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.




LUCIUS



Varro and Claudius!



Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS




VARRO



Calls my lord?




BRUTUS



I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;


It may be I shall raise you by and by


On business to my brother Cassius.




VARRO



So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.




BRUTUS



I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;


It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.


Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;


I put it in the pocket of my gown.



VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down




LUCIUS



I was sure your lordship did not give it me.




BRUTUS



Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.


Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,


And touch thy instrument a strain or two?




LUCIUS



Ay, my lord, an't please you.




BRUTUS



It does, my boy:


I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.




LUCIUS



It is my duty, sir.




BRUTUS



I should not urge thy duty past thy might;


I know young bloods look for a time of rest.




LUCIUS



I have slept, my lord, already.




BRUTUS



It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;


I will not hold thee long: if I do live,


I will be good to thee.



Music, and a song


This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,


Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,


That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;


I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:


If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;


I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.


Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down


Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.



Enter the Ghost of CAESAR


How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?


I think it is the weakness of mine eyes


That shapes this monstrous apparition.


It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?


Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,


That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?


Speak to me what thou art.




GHOST



Thy evil spirit, Brutus.




BRUTUS



Why comest thou?




GHOST



To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.




BRUTUS



Well; then I shall see thee again?




GHOST



Ay, at Philippi.




BRUTUS



Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.



Exit Ghost


Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:


Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.


Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!




LUCIUS



The strings, my lord, are false.




BRUTUS



He thinks he still is at his instrument.


Lucius, awake!




LUCIUS



My lord?




BRUTUS



Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?




LUCIUS



My lord, I do not know that I did cry.




BRUTUS



Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?




LUCIUS



Nothing, my lord.




BRUTUS



Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!



To VARRO


Fellow thou, awake!




VARRO



My lord?




CLAUDIUS



My lord?




BRUTUS



Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?




VARRO



CLAUDIUS



Did we, my lord?




BRUTUS



Ay: saw you any thing?




VARRO



No, my lord, I saw nothing.




CLAUDIUS



Nor I, my lord.




BRUTUS



Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;


Bid him set on his powers betimes before,


And we will follow.




VARRO



CLAUDIUS



It shall be done, my lord.



Exeunt




ACT V

SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.



Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army



OCTAVIUS



Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:


You said the enemy would not come down,


But keep the hills and upper regions;


It proves not so: their battles are at hand;


They mean to warn us at Philippi here,


Answering before we do demand of them.




ANTONY



Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know


Wherefore they do it: they could be content


To visit other places; and come down


With fearful bravery, thinking by this face


To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;


But 'tis not so.



Enter a Messenger




Messenger



Prepare you, generals:


The enemy comes on in gallant show;


Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,


And something to be done immediately.




ANTONY



Octavius, lead your battle softly on,


Upon the left hand of the even field.




OCTAVIUS



Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.




ANTONY



Why do you cross me in this exigent?




OCTAVIUS



I do not cross you; but I will do so.



March



Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army; LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others




BRUTUS



They stand, and would have parley.




CASSIUS



Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.




OCTAVIUS



Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?




ANTONY



No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.


Make forth; the generals would have some words.




OCTAVIUS



Stir not until the signal.




BRUTUS



Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?




OCTAVIUS



Not that we love words better, as you do.




BRUTUS



Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.




ANTONY



In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:


Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,


Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'




CASSIUS



Antony,


The posture of your blows are yet unknown;


But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,


And leave them honeyless.




ANTONY



Not stingless too.




BRUTUS



O, yes, and soundless too;


For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,


And very wisely threat before you sting.




ANTONY



Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers


Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:


You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,


And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;


Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind


Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!




CASSIUS



Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:


This tongue had not offended so to-day,


If Cassius might have ruled.




OCTAVIUS



Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,


The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;


I draw a sword against conspirators;


When think you that the sword goes up again?


Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds


Be well avenged; or till another Caesar


Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.




BRUTUS



Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,


Unless thou bring'st them with thee.




OCTAVIUS



So I hope;


I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.




BRUTUS



O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,


Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.




CASSIUS



A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,


Join'd with a masker and a reveller!




ANTONY



Old Cassius still!




OCTAVIUS



Come, Antony, away!


Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:


If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;


If not, when you have stomachs.



Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army




CASSIUS



Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!


The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.




BRUTUS



Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.




LUCILIUS



[Standing forth]	My lord?



BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart




CASSIUS



Messala!




MESSALA



[Standing forth]  What says my general?




CASSIUS



Messala,


This is my birth-day; as this very day


Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:


Be thou my witness that against my will,


As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set


Upon one battle all our liberties.


You know that I held Epicurus strong


And his opinion: now I change my mind,


And partly credit things that do presage.


Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign


Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,


Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;


Who to Philippi here consorted us:


This morning are they fled away and gone;


And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,


Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,


As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem


A canopy most fatal, under which


Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.




MESSALA



Believe not so.




CASSIUS



I but believe it partly;


For I am fresh of spirit and resolved


To meet all perils very constantly.




BRUTUS



Even so, Lucilius.




CASSIUS



Now, most noble Brutus,


The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,


Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!


But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,


Let's reason with the worst that may befall.


If we do lose this battle, then is this


The very last time we shall speak together:


What are you then determined to do?




BRUTUS



Even by the rule of that philosophy


By which I did blame Cato for the death


Which he did give himself, I know not how,


But I do find it cowardly and vile,


For fear of what might fall, so to prevent


The time of life: arming myself with patience


To stay the providence of some high powers


That govern us below.




CASSIUS



Then, if we lose this battle,


You are contented to be led in triumph


Thorough the streets of Rome?




BRUTUS



No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,


That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;


He bears too great a mind. But this same day


Must end that work the ides of March begun;


And whether we shall meet again I know not.


Therefore our everlasting farewell take:


For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!


If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;


If not, why then, this parting was well made.




CASSIUS



For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!


If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;


If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.




BRUTUS



Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know


The end of this day's business ere it come!


But it sufficeth that the day will end,


And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!



Exeunt



SCENE II. The same. The field of battle.



Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA



BRUTUS



Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills


Unto the legions on the other side.



Loud alarum


Let them set on at once; for I perceive


But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,


And sudden push gives them the overthrow.


Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.



Exeunt



SCENE III. Another part of the field.



Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS



CASSIUS



O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!


Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:


This ensign here of mine was turning back;


I slew the coward, and did take it from him.




TITINIUS



O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;


Who, having some advantage on Octavius,


Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,


Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.



Enter PINDARUS




PINDARUS



Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;


Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord


Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.




CASSIUS



This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;


Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?




TITINIUS



They are, my lord.




CASSIUS



Titinius, if thou lovest me,


Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,


Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,


And here again; that I may rest assured


Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.




TITINIUS



I will be here again, even with a thought.



Exit




CASSIUS



Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;


My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,


And tell me what thou notest about the field.



PINDARUS ascends the hill


This day I breathed first: time is come round,


And where I did begin, there shall I end;


My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?




PINDARUS



[Above]  O my lord!




CASSIUS



What news?




PINDARUS



[Above]  Titinius is enclosed round about


With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;


Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.


Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.


He's ta'en.



Shout


And, hark! they shout for joy.




CASSIUS



Come down, behold no more.


O, coward that I am, to live so long,


To see my best friend ta'en before my face!



PINDARUS descends


Come hither, sirrah:


In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;


And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,


That whatsoever I did bid thee do,


Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;


Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,


That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.


Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;


And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,


Guide thou the sword.



PINDARUS stabs him


Caesar, thou art revenged,


Even with the sword that kill'd thee.



Dies




PINDARUS



So, I am free; yet would not so have been,


Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,


Far from this country Pindarus shall run,


Where never Roman shall take note of him.



Exit



Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA




MESSALA



It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius


Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,


As Cassius' legions are by Antony.




TITINIUS



These tidings will well comfort Cassius.




MESSALA



Where did you leave him?




TITINIUS



All disconsolate,


With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.




MESSALA



Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground?




TITINIUS



He lies not like the living. O my heart!




MESSALA



Is not that he?




TITINIUS



No, this was he, Messala,


But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,


As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,


So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;


The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;


Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!


Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.




MESSALA



Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.


O hateful error, melancholy's child,


Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men


The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,


Thou never comest unto a happy birth,


But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!




TITINIUS



What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?




MESSALA



Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet


The noble Brutus, thrusting this report


Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;


For piercing steel and darts envenomed


Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus


As tidings of this sight.




TITINIUS



Hie you, Messala,


And I will seek for Pindarus the while.



Exit MESSALA


Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?


Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they


Put on my brows this wreath of victory,


And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?


Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!


But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;


Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I


Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,


And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.


By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part


Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.



Kills himself



Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO, STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS




BRUTUS



Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?




MESSALA



Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.




BRUTUS



Titinius' face is upward.




CATO



He is slain.




BRUTUS



O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!


Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords


In our own proper entrails.



Low alarums




CATO



Brave Titinius!


Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!




BRUTUS



Are yet two Romans living such as these?


The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!


It is impossible that ever Rome


Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears


To this dead man than you shall see me pay.


I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.


Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:


His funerals shall not be in our camp,


Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;


And come, young Cato; let us to the field.


Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:


'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night


We shall try fortune in a second fight.



Exeunt



SCENE IV. Another part of the field.



Alarum. Enter fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then BRUTUS, CATO, LUCILIUS, and others



BRUTUS



Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!




CATO



What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?


I will proclaim my name about the field:


I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!


A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;


I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!




BRUTUS



And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;


Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!



Exit




LUCILIUS



O young and noble Cato, art thou down?


Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;


And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.




First Soldier



Yield, or thou diest.




LUCILIUS



Only I yield to die:


There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;



Offering money


Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.




First Soldier



We must not. A noble prisoner!




Second Soldier



Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.




First Soldier



I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.



Enter ANTONY


Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.




ANTONY



Where is he?




LUCILIUS



Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:


I dare assure thee that no enemy


Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:


The gods defend him from so great a shame!


When you do find him, or alive or dead,


He will be found like Brutus, like himself.




ANTONY



This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,


A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;


Give him all kindness: I had rather have


Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,


And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;


And bring us word unto Octavius' tent


How every thing is chanced.



Exeunt



SCENE V. Another part of the field.



Enter BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and VOLUMNIUS



BRUTUS



Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.




CLITUS



Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,


He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.




BRUTUS



Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;


It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.



Whispers




CLITUS



What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.




BRUTUS



Peace then! no words.




CLITUS



I'll rather kill myself.




BRUTUS



Hark thee, Dardanius.



Whispers




DARDANIUS



Shall I do such a deed?




CLITUS



O Dardanius!




DARDANIUS



O Clitus!




CLITUS



What ill request did Brutus make to thee?




DARDANIUS



To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.




CLITUS



Now is that noble vessel full of grief,


That it runs over even at his eyes.




BRUTUS



Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.




VOLUMNIUS



What says my lord?




BRUTUS



Why, this, Volumnius:


The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me


Two several times by night; at Sardis once,


And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:


I know my hour is come.




VOLUMNIUS



Not so, my lord.




BRUTUS



Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.


Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;


Our enemies have beat us to the pit:



Low alarums


It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,


Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,


Thou know'st that we two went to school together:


Even for that our love of old, I prithee,


Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.




VOLUMNIUS



That's not an office for a friend, my lord.



Alarum still




CLITUS



Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.




BRUTUS



Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.


Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;


Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,


My heart doth joy that yet in all my life


I found no man but he was true to me.


I shall have glory by this losing day


More than Octavius and Mark Antony


By this vile conquest shall attain unto.


So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue


Hath almost ended his life's history:


Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,


That have but labour'd to attain this hour.



Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'




CLITUS



Fly, my lord, fly.




BRUTUS



Hence! I will follow.



Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS


I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:


Thou art a fellow of a good respect;


Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:


Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,


While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?




STRATO



Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.




BRUTUS



Farewell, good Strato.



Runs on his sword


Caesar, now be still:


I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.



Dies



Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA, LUCILIUS, and the army




OCTAVIUS



What man is that?




MESSALA



My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?




STRATO



Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:


The conquerors can but make a fire of him;


For Brutus only overcame himself,


And no man else hath honour by his death.




LUCILIUS



So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,


That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.




OCTAVIUS



All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.


Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?




STRATO



Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.




OCTAVIUS



Do so, good Messala.




MESSALA



How died my master, Strato?




STRATO



I held the sword, and he did run on it.




MESSALA



Octavius, then take him to follow thee,


That did the latest service to my master.




ANTONY



This was the noblest Roman of them all:


All the conspirators save only he


Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;


He only, in a general honest thought


And common good to all, made one of them.


His life was gentle, and the elements


So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up


And say to all the world 'This was a man!'




OCTAVIUS



According to his virtue let us use him,


With all respect and rites of burial.


Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,


Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.


So call the field to rest; and let's away,


To part the glories of this happy day.



Exeunt



CHESS OF YORK

Not yet, I thee beseech:

For ever will I walk upon my knees,

And never see day that the happy sees,

Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,

By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.


DUKE OF AUMERLE

Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.


DUKE OF YORK

Against them both my true joints bended be.

Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!


DUCHESS OF YORK

Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;

His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;

His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:

He prays but faintly and would be denied;

We pray with heart and soul and all beside:

His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;

Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:

His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;

Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.

Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have

That mercy which true prayer ought to have.


HENRY BOLINGBROKE

Good aunt, stand up.


DUCHESS OF YORK

Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'

Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'

And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,

'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.

I never long'd to hear a word till now;

Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:

The word is short, but not so short as sweet;

No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.


DUKE OF YORK

Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'


DUCHESS OF YORK

Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?

Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,

That set'st the word itself against the word!

Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;

The chopping French we do not understand.

Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;

Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;

That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,

Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.


HENRY BOLINGBROKE

Good aunt, stand up.


DUCHESS OF YORK

I do not sue to stand;

Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.


HENRY BOLINGBROKE

I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.


DUCHESS OF YORK

O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!

Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;

Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,

But makes one pardon strong.


HENRY BOLINGBROKE

With all my heart

I pardon him.


DUCHESS OF YORK

                  A god on earth thou art.


HENRY BOLINGBROKE

But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,

With all the rest of that consorted crew,

Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.

Good uncle, help to order several powers

To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:

They shall not live within this world, I swear,

But I will have them, if I once know where.

Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:

Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.


DUCHESS OF YORK

Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.


Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same.

Enter EXTON and Servant

EXTON

Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,

'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'

Was it not so?


Servant

                  These were his very words.


EXTON

'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,

And urged it twice together, did he not?


Servant

He did.


EXTON

And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,

And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'

That would divorce this terror from my heart;'

Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:

I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.


Exeunt

SCENE V. Pomfret castle.

Enter KING RICHARD

KING RICHARD II

I have been studying how I may compare

This prison where I live unto the world:

And for because the world is populous

And here is not a creature but myself,

I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.

My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,

My soul the father; and these two beget

A generation of still-breeding thoughts,

And these same thoughts people this little world,

In humours like the people of this world,

For no thought is contented. The better sort,

As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd

With scruples and do set the word itself

Against the word:

As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,

'It is as hard to come as for a camel

To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'

Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot

Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails

May tear a passage through the flinty ribs

Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,

And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.

Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves

That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,

Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars

Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,

That many have and others must sit there;

And in this thought they find a kind of ease,

Bearing their own misfortunes on the back

Of such as have before endured the like.

Thus play I in one person many people,

And none contented: sometimes am I king;

Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,

And so I am: then crushing penury

Persuades me I was better when a king;

Then am I king'd again: and by and by

Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,

And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,

Nor I nor any man that but man is

With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased

With being nothing. Music do I hear?


Music

Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,

When time is broke and no proportion kept!

So is it in the music of men's lives.

And here have I the daintiness of ear

To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;

But for the concord of my state and time

Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.

I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;

For now hath time made me his numbering clock:

My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar

Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,

Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,

Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.

Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is

Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,

Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans

Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time

Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,

While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.

This music mads me; let it sound no more;

For though it have holp madmen to their wits,

In me it seems it will make wise men mad.

Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!

For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard

Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.


Enter a Groom of the Stable


Groom

Hail, royal prince!


KING RICHARD II

Thanks, noble peer;

The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.

What art thou? and how comest thou hither,

Where no man never comes but that sad dog

That brings me food to make misfortune live?


Groom

I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,

When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,

With much ado at length have gotten leave

To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.

O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld

In London streets, that coronation-day,

When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,

That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,

That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!


KING RICHARD II

Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,

How went he under him?


Groom

So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.


KING RICHARD II

So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!

That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;

This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.

Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,

Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck

Of that proud man that did usurp his back?

Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,

Since thou, created to be awed by man,

Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;

And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,

Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.


Enter Keeper, with a dish


Keeper

Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.


KING RICHARD II

If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.


Groom

What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.


Exit


Keeper

My lord, will't please you to fall to?


KING RICHARD II

Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.


Keeper

My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who

lately came from the king, commands the contrary.


KING RICHARD II

The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!

Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.


Beats the keeper


Keeper

Help, help, help!


Enter EXTON and Servants, armed


KING RICHARD II

How now! what means death in this rude assault?

Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.


Snatching an axe from a Servant and killing him

Go thou, and fill another room in hell.


He kills another. Then Exton strikes him down

That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire

That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand

Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.

Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;

Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.


Dies


EXTON

As full of valour as of royal blood:

Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!

For now the devil, that told me I did well,

Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.

This dead king to the living king I'll bear

Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.


Exeunt

SCENE VI. Windsor castle.

Flourish. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK, with other Lords, and Attendants

HENRY BOLINGBROKE

Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear

Is that the rebels have consumed with fire

Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;

But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.


Enter NORTHUMBERLAND

Welcome, my lord	what is the news?


NORTHUMBERLAND

First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.

The next news is, I have to London sent

The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:

The manner of their taking may appear

At large discoursed in this paper here.


HENRY BOLINGBROKE

We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;

And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.


Enter LORD FITZWATER


LORD FITZWATER

My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London

The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,

Two of the dangerous consorted traitors

That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.


HENRY BOLINGBROKE

Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;

Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.


Enter HENRY PERCY, and the BISHOP OF CARLISLE


HENRY PERCY

The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,

With clog of conscience and sour melancholy

Hath yielded up his body to the grave;

But here is Carlisle living, to abide

Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.


HENRY BOLINGBROKE

Carlisle, this is your doom:

Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,

More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;

So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:

For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,

High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.


Enter EXTON, with persons bearing a coffin


EXTON

Great king, within this coffin I present

Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies

The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,

Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.


HENRY BOLINGBROKE

Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought

A deed of slander with thy fatal hand

Upon my head and all this famous land.


EXTON

From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.


HENRY BOLINGBROKE

They love not poison that do poison need,

Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,

I hate the murderer, love him murdered.

The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,

But neither my good word nor princely favour:

With Cain go wander through shades of night,

And never show thy head by day nor light.

Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,

That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:

Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,

And put on sullen black incontinent:

I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,

To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:

March sadly after; grace my mournings here;

In weeping after this untimely bier.


Exeunt




QUEEN GERTRUDE

But not by him.


KING CLAUDIUS

Let him demand his fill.


LAERTES

How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:

To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!

Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!

I dare damnation. To this point I stand,

That both the worlds I give to negligence,

Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged

Most thoroughly for my father.


KING CLAUDIUS

Who shall stay you?


LAERTES

My will, not all the world:

And for my means, I'll husband them so well,

They shall go far with little.


KING CLAUDIUS

Good Laertes,

If you desire to know the certainty

Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,

That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,

Winner and loser?


LAERTES

None but his enemies.


KING CLAUDIUS

Will you know them then?


LAERTES

To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;

And like the kind life-rendering pelican,

Repast them with my blood.


KING CLAUDIUS

Why, now you speak

Like a good child and a true gentleman.

That I am guiltless of your father's death,

And am most sensible in grief for it,

It shall as level to your judgment pierce

As day does to your eye.


Danes

[Within]                Let her come in.


LAERTES

How now! what noise is that?


Re-enter OPHELIA

O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,

Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!

By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,

Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!

Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!

O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits

Should be as moral as an old man's life?

Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,

It sends some precious instance of itself

After the thing it loves.


OPHELIA

[Sings]

They bore him barefaced on the bier;

Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;

And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--

Fare you well, my dove!


LAERTES

Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,

It could not move thus.


OPHELIA

[Sings]

You must sing a-down a-down,

An you call him a-down-a.

O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false

steward, that stole his master's daughter.


LAERTES

This nothing's more than matter.


OPHELIA

There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,

love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.


LAERTES

A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.


OPHELIA

There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue

for you; and here's some for me: we may call it

herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with

a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you

some violets, but they withered all when my father

died: they say he made a good end,--


Sings

For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.


LAERTES

Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,

She turns to favour and to prettiness.


OPHELIA

[Sings]

And will he not come again?

And will he not come again?

No, no, he is dead:

Go to thy death-bed:

He never will come again.

His beard was as white as snow,

All flaxen was his poll:

He is gone, he is gone,

And we cast away moan:

God ha' mercy on his soul!

And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.


Exit


LAERTES

Do you see this, O God?


KING CLAUDIUS

Laertes, I must commune with your grief,

Or you deny me right. Go but apart,

Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.

And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:

If by direct or by collateral hand

They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,

Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,

To you in satisfaction; but if not,

Be you content to lend your patience to us,

And we shall jointly labour with your soul

To give it due content.


LAERTES

Let this be so;

His means of death, his obscure funeral--

No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,

No noble rite nor formal ostentation--

Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,

That I must call't in question.


KING CLAUDIUS

So you shall;

And where the offence is let the great axe fall.

I pray you, go with me.


Exeunt

SCENE VI. Another room in the castle.

Enter HORATIO and a Servant

HORATIO

What are they that would speak with me?


Servant

Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.


HORATIO

Let them come in.


Exit Servant

I do not know from what part of the world

I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.


Enter Sailors


First Sailor

God bless you, sir.


HORATIO

Let him bless thee too.


First Sailor

He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for

you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was

bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am

let to know it is.


HORATIO

[Reads]  'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked

this, give these fellows some means to the king:

they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old

at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us

chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on

a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded

them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so

I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with

me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they

did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king

have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me

with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I

have words to speak in thine ear will make thee

dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of

the matter. These good fellows will bring thee

where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their

course for England: of them I have much to tell

thee. Farewell.

'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

Come, I will make you way for these your letters;

And do't the speedier, that you may direct me

To him from whom you brought them.


Exeunt

SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.

Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES

KING CLAUDIUS

Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,

And you must put me in your heart for friend,

Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,

That he which hath your noble father slain

Pursued my life.


LAERTES

                  It well appears: but tell me

Why you proceeded not against these feats,

So crimeful and so capital in nature,

As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,

You mainly were stirr'd up.


KING CLAUDIUS

O, for two special reasons;

Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,

But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother

Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--

My virtue or my plague, be it either which--

She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,

That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,

I could not but by her. The other motive,

Why to a public count I might not go,

Is the great love the general gender bear him;

Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,

Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,

Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,

Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,

Would have reverted to my bow again,

And not where I had aim'd them.


LAERTES

And so have I a noble father lost;

A sister driven into desperate terms,

Whose worth, if praises may go back again,

Stood challenger on mount of all the age

For her perfections: but my revenge will come.


KING CLAUDIUS

Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think

That we are made of stuff so flat and dull

That we can let our beard be shook with danger

And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:

I loved your father, and we love ourself;

And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--


Enter a Messenger

How now! what news?


Messenger

Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:

This to your majesty; this to the queen.


KING CLAUDIUS

From Hamlet! who brought them?


Messenger

Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:

They were given me by Claudio; he received them

Of him that brought them.


KING CLAUDIUS

Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.


Exit Messenger


Reads

'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on

your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see

your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your

pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden

and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'

What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?

Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?


LAERTES

Know you the hand?


KING CLAUDIUS

'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!

And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'

Can you advise me?


LAERTES

I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;

It warms the very sickness in my heart,

That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,

'Thus didest thou.'


KING CLAUDIUS

If it be so, Laertes--

As how should it be so? how otherwise?--

Will you be ruled by me?


LAERTES

Ay, my lord;

So you will not o'errule me to a peace.


KING CLAUDIUS

To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,

As checking at his voyage, and that he means

No more to undertake it, I will work him

To an exploit, now ripe in my device,

Under the which he shall not choose but fall:

And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,

But even his mother shall uncharge the practise

And call it accident.


LAERTES

My lord, I will be ruled;

The rather, if you could devise it so

That I might be the organ.


KING CLAUDIUS

It falls right.

You have been talk'd of since your travel much,

And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality

Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts

Did not together pluck such envy from him

As did that one, and that, in my regard,

Of the unworthiest siege.


LAERTES

What part is that, my lord?


KING CLAUDIUS

A very riband in the cap of youth,

Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes

The light and careless livery that it wears

Than settled age his sables and his weeds,

Importing health and graveness. Two months since,

Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--

I've seen myself, and served against, the French,

And they can well on horseback: but this gallant

Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;

And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,

As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured

With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,

That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,

Come short of what he did.


LAERTES

A Norman was't?


KING CLAUDIUS

A Norman.


LAERTES

Upon my life, Lamond.


KING CLAUDIUS

The very same.


LAERTES

I know him well: he is the brooch indeed

And gem of all the nation.


KING CLAUDIUS

He made confession of you,

And gave you such a masterly report

For art and exercise in your defence

And for your rapier most especially,

That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,

If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,

He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,

If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his

Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy

That he could nothing do but wish and beg

Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.

Now, out of this,--


LAERTES

What out of this, my lord?


KING CLAUDIUS

Laertes, was your father dear to you?

Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,

A face without a heart?


LAERTES

Why ask you this?


KING CLAUDIUS

Not that I think you did not love your father;

But that I know love is begun by time;

And that I see, in passages of proof,

Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.

There lives within the very flame of love

A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;

And nothing is at a like goodness still;

For goodness, growing to a plurisy,

Dies in his own too much: that we would do

We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes

And hath abatements and delays as many

As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;

And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,

That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--

Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,

To show yourself your father's son in deed

More than in words?


LAERTES

To cut his throat i' the church.


KING CLAUDIUS

No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;

Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,

Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.

Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:

We'll put on those shall praise your excellence

And set a double varnish on the fame

The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together

And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,

Most generous and free from all contriving,

Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,

Or with a little shuffling, you may choose

A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise

Requite him for your father.


LAERTES

I will do't:

And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.

I bought an unction of a mountebank,

So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,

Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,

Collected from all simples that have virtue

Under the moon, can save the thing from death

That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point

With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,

It may be death.


KING CLAUDIUS

                  Let's further think of this;

Weigh what convenience both of time and means

May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,

And that our drift look through our bad performance,

'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project

Should have a back or second, that might hold,

If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:

We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.

When in your motion you are hot and dry--

As make your bouts more violent to that end--

And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him

A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,

If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,

Our purpose may hold there.


Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE

How now, sweet queen!


QUEEN GERTRUDE

One woe doth tread upon another's heel,

So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.


LAERTES

Drown'd! O, where?


QUEEN GERTRUDE

There is a willow grows aslant a brook,

That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;

There with fantastic garlands did she come

Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples

That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,

But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:

There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds

Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;

When down her weedy trophies and herself

Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;

And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:

Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;

As one incapable of her own distress,

Or like a creature native and indued

Unto that element: but long it could not be

Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,

Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay

To muddy death.


LAERTES

                  Alas, then, she is drown'd?


QUEEN GERTRUDE

Drown'd, drown'd.


LAERTES

Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,

And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet

It is our trick; nature her custom holds,

Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,

The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:

I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,

But that this folly douts it.


Exit


KING CLAUDIUS

Let's follow, Gertrude:

How much I had to do to calm his rage!

Now fear I this will give it start again;

Therefore let's follow.


Exeunt


ACT V
SCENE I. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, with spades,  & c

First Clown

Is she to be buried in Christian burial that

wilfully seeks her own salvation?


Second Clown

I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave

straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it

Christian burial.


First Clown

How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her

own defence?


Second Clown

Why, 'tis found so.


First Clown

It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For

here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,

it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it

is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned

herself wittingly.


Second Clown

Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--


First Clown

Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here

stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,

and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he

goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him

and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he

that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.


Second Clown

But is this law?


First Clown

Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.


Second Clown

Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been

a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'

Christian burial.


First Clown

Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that

great folk should have countenance in this world to

drown or hang themselves, more than their even

Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient

gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:

they hold up Adam's profession.


Second Clown

Was he a gentleman?


First Clown

He was the first that ever bore arms.


Second Clown

Why, he had none.


First Clown

What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the

Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'

could he dig without arms? I'll put another

question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the

purpose, confess thyself--


Second Clown

Go to.


First Clown

What is he that builds stronger than either the

mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?


Second Clown

The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a

thousand tenants.


First Clown

I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows

does well; but how does it well? it does well to

those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the

gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,

the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.


Second Clown

'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or

a carpenter?'


First Clown

Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.


Second Clown

Marry, now I can tell.


First Clown

To't.


Second Clown

Mass, I cannot tell.


Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance


First Clown

Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull

ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when

you are asked this question next, say 'a

grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till

doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a

stoup of liquor.


Exit Second Clown


He digs and sings

In youth, when I did love, did love,

Methought it was very sweet,

To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,

O, methought, there was nothing meet.


HAMLET

Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he

sings at grave-making?


HORATIO

Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.


HAMLET

'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath

the daintier sense.


First Clown

[Sings]

But age, with his stealing steps,

Hath claw'd me in his clutch,

And hath shipped me intil the land,

As if I had never been such.


Throws up a skull


HAMLET

That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:

how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were

Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It

might be the pate of a politician, which this ass

now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,

might it not?


HORATIO

It might, my lord.


HAMLET

Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,

sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might

be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord

such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?


HORATIO

Ay, my lord.


HAMLET

Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and

knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:

here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to

see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,

but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.


First Clown

[Sings]

A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,

For and a shrouding sheet:

O, a pit of clay for to be made

For such a guest is meet.


Throws up another skull


HAMLET

There's another: why may not that be the skull of a

lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,

his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he

suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the

sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of

his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be

in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,

his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,

his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and

the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine

pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him

no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than

the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The

very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in

this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?


HORATIO

Not a jot more, my lord.


HAMLET

Is not parchment made of sheepskins?


HORATIO

Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.


HAMLET

They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance

in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose

grave's this, sirrah?


First Clown

Mine, sir.


Sings

O, a pit of clay for to be made

For such a guest is meet.


HAMLET

I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.


First Clown

You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not

yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.


HAMLET

'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:

'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.


First Clown

'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to

you.


HAMLET

What man dost thou dig it for?


First Clown

For no man, sir.


HAMLET

What woman, then?


First Clown

For none, neither.


HAMLET

Who is to be buried in't?


First Clown

One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.


HAMLET

How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the

card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,

Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of

it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the

peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he

gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a

grave-maker?


First Clown

Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day

that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.


HAMLET

How long is that since?


First Clown

Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it

was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that

is mad, and sent into England.


HAMLET

Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?


First Clown

Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits

there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.


HAMLET

Why?


First Clown

'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men

are as mad as he.


HAMLET

How came he mad?


First Clown

Very strangely, they say.


HAMLET

How strangely?


First Clown

Faith, e'en with losing his wits.


HAMLET

Upon what ground?


First Clown

Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man

and boy, thirty years.


HAMLET

How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?


First Clown

I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we

have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce

hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year

or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.


HAMLET

Why he more than another?


First Clown

Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that

he will keep out water a great while; and your water

is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.

Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth

three and twenty years.


HAMLET

Whose was it?


First Clown

A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?


HAMLET

Nay, I know not.


First Clown

A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a

flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,

sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.


HAMLET

This?


First Clown

E'en that.


HAMLET

Let me see.


Takes the skull

Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow

of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath

borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how

abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at

it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know

not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your

gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,

that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one

now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?

Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let

her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must

come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell

me one thing.


HORATIO

What's that, my lord?


HAMLET

Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'

the earth?


HORATIO

E'en so.


HAMLET

And smelt so? pah!


Puts down the skull


HORATIO

E'en so, my lord.


HAMLET

To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may

not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,

till he find it stopping a bung-hole?


HORATIO

'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.


HAMLET

No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with

modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as

thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,

Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of

earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he

was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?

Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,

Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:

O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,

Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!

But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.


Enter Priest,  & c. in procession; the Corpse of  OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains,  & c

The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?

And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken

The corse they follow did with desperate hand

Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.

Couch we awhile, and mark.


Retiring with HORATIO


LAERTES

What ceremony else?


HAMLET

That is Laertes,

A very noble youth: mark.


LAERTES

What ceremony else?


First Priest

Her obsequies have been as far enlarged

As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;

And, but that great command o'ersways the order,

She should in ground unsanctified have lodged

Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,

Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;

Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,

Her maiden strewments and the bringing home

Of bell and burial.


LAERTES

Must there no more be done?


First Priest

No more be done:

We should profane the service of the dead

To sing a requiem and such rest to her

As to peace-parted souls.


LAERTES

Lay her i' the earth:

And from her fair and unpolluted flesh

May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,

A ministering angel shall my sister be,

When thou liest howling.


HAMLET

What, the fair Ophelia!


QUEEN GERTRUDE

Sweets to the sweet: farewell!


Scattering flowers

I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;

I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,

And not have strew'd thy grave.


LAERTES

O, treble woe

Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,

Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense

Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,

Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:


Leaps into the grave

Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,

Till of this flat a mountain you have made,

To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head

Of blue Olympus.


HAMLET

[Advancing]     What is he whose grief

Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow

Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand

Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,

Hamlet the Dane.


Leaps into the grave


LAERTES

                  The devil take thy soul!


Grappling with him


HAMLET

Thou pray'st not well.

I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;

For, though I am not splenitive and rash,

Yet have I something in me dangerous,

Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.


KING CLAUDIUS

Pluck them asunder.


QUEEN GERTRUDE

Hamlet, Hamlet!


All

Gentlemen,--


HORATIO

                  Good my lord, be quiet.


The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave


HAMLET

Why I will fight with him upon this theme

Until my eyelids will no longer wag.


QUEEN GERTRUDE

O my son, what theme?


HAMLET

I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers

Could not, with all their quantity of love,

Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?


KING CLAUDIUS

O, he is mad, Laertes.


QUEEN GERTRUDE

For love of God, forbear him.


HAMLET

'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:

Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?

Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?

I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?

To outface me with leaping in her grave?

Be buried quick with her, and so will I:

And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw

Millions of acres on us, till our ground,

Singeing his pate against the burning zone,

Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,

I'll rant as well as thou.


QUEEN GERTRUDE

This is mere madness:

And thus awhile the fit will work on him;

Anon, as patient as the female dove,

When that her golden couplets are disclosed,

His silence will sit drooping.


HAMLET

Hear you, sir;

What is the reason that you use me thus?

I loved you ever: but it is no matter;

Let Hercules himself do what he may,

The cat will mew and dog will have his day.


Exit


KING CLAUDIUS

I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.


Exit HORATIO


To LAERTES

Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;

We'll put the matter to the present push.

Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.

This grave shall have a living monument:

An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;

Till then, in patience our proceeding be.


Exeunt

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.

Enter HAMLET and HORATIO

HAMLET

So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;

You do remember all the circumstance?


HORATIO

Remember it, my lord?


HAMLET

Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,

That would not let me sleep: methought I lay

Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,

And praised be rashness for it, let us know,

Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,

When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us

There's a divinity that shapes our ends,

Rough-hew them how we will,--


HORATIO

That is most certain.


HAMLET

Up from my cabin,

My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark

Groped I to find out them; had my desire.

Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew

To mine own room again; making so bold,

My fears forgetting manners, to unseal

Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--

O royal knavery!--an exact command,

Larded with many several sorts of reasons

Importing Denmark's health and England's too,

With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,

That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,

No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,

My head should be struck off.


HORATIO

Is't possible?


HAMLET

Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.

But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?


HORATIO

I beseech you.


HAMLET

Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--

Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,

They had begun the play--I sat me down,

Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:

I once did hold it, as our statists do,

A baseness to write fair and labour'd much

How to forget that learning, but, sir, now

It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know

The effect of what I wrote?


HORATIO

Ay, good my lord.


HAMLET

An earnest conjuration from the king,

As England was his faithful tributary,

As love between them like the palm might flourish,

As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear

And stand a comma 'tween their amities,

And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,

That, on the view and knowing of these contents,

Without debatement further, more or less,

He should the bearers put to sudden death,

Not shriving-time allow'd.


HORATIO

How was this seal'd?


HAMLET

Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.

I had my father's signet in my purse,

Which was the model of that Danish seal;

Folded the writ up in form of the other,

Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,

The changeling never known. Now, the next day

Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent

Thou know'st already.


HORATIO

So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.


HAMLET

Why, man, they did make love to this employment;

They are not near my conscience; their defeat

Does by their own insinuation grow:

'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes

Between the pass and fell incensed points

Of mighty opposites.


HORATIO

Why, what a king is this!


HAMLET

Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--

He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,

Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,

Thrown out his angle for my proper life,

And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,

To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,

To let this canker of our nature come

In further evil?


HORATIO

It must be shortly known to him from England

What is the issue of the business there.


HAMLET

It will be short: the interim is mine;

And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'

But I am very sorry, good Horatio,

That to Laertes I forgot myself;

For, by the image of my cause, I see

The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.

But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me

Into a towering passion.


HORATIO

Peace! who comes here?


Enter OSRIC


OSRIC

Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.


HAMLET

I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?


HORATIO

No, my good lord.


HAMLET

Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to

know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a

beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at

the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,

spacious in the possession of dirt.


OSRIC

Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I

should impart a thing to you from his majesty.


HAMLET

I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of

spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.


OSRIC

I thank your lordship, it is very hot.


HAMLET

No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is

northerly.


OSRIC

It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.


HAMLET

But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my

complexion.


OSRIC

Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as

'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his

majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a

great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--


HAMLET

I beseech you, remember--


HAMLET moves him to put on his hat


OSRIC

Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.

Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe

me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent

differences, of very soft society and great showing:

indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or

calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the

continent of what part a gentleman would see.


HAMLET

Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;

though, I know, to divide him inventorially would

dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw

neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the

verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of

great article; and his infusion of such dearth and

rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his

semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace

him, his umbrage, nothing more.


OSRIC

Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.


HAMLET

The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman

in our more rawer breath?


OSRIC

Sir?


HORATIO

Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?

You will do't, sir, really.


HAMLET

What imports the nomination of this gentleman?


OSRIC

Of Laertes?


HORATIO

His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.


HAMLET

Of him, sir.


OSRIC

I know you are not ignorant--


HAMLET

I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,

it would not much approve me. Well, sir?


OSRIC

You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--


HAMLET

I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with

him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to

know himself.


OSRIC

I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation

laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.


HAMLET

What's his weapon?


OSRIC

Rapier and dagger.


HAMLET

That's two of his weapons: but, well.


OSRIC

The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary

horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take

it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their

assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the

carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very

responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,

and of very liberal conceit.


HAMLET

What call you the carriages?


HORATIO

I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.


OSRIC

The carriages, sir, are the hangers.


HAMLET

The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we

could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might

be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses

against six French swords, their assigns, and three

liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet

against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?


OSRIC

The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes

between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you

three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it

would come to immediate trial, if your lordship

would vouchsafe the answer.


HAMLET

How if I answer 'no'?


OSRIC

I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.


HAMLET

Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his

majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let

the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the

king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;

if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.


OSRIC

Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?


HAMLET

To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.


OSRIC

I commend my duty to your lordship.


HAMLET

Yours, yours.


Exit OSRIC

He does well to commend it himself; there are no

tongues else for's turn.


HORATIO

This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.


HAMLET

He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.

Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I

know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of

the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of

yesty collection, which carries them through and

through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do

but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.


Enter a Lord


Lord

My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young

Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in

the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to

play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.


HAMLET

I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's

pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now

or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.


Lord

The king and queen and all are coming down.


HAMLET

In happy time.


Lord

The queen desires you to use some gentle

entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.


HAMLET

She well instructs me.


Exit Lord


HORATIO

You will lose this wager, my lord.


HAMLET

I do not think so: since he went into France, I

have been in continual practise: I shall win at the

odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here

about my heart: but it is no matter.


HORATIO

Nay, good my lord,--


HAMLET

It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of

gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.


HORATIO

If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will

forestall their repair hither, and say you are not

fit.


HAMLET

Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special

providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,

'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be

now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the

readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he

leaves, what is't to leave betimes?


Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils,  & c


KING CLAUDIUS

Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.


KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's


HAMLET

Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;

But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.

This presence knows,

And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd

With sore distraction. What I have done,

That might your nature, honour and exception

Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.

Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:

If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,

And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,

Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.

Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,

Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;

His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.

Sir, in this audience,

Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil

Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,

That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,

And hurt my brother.


LAERTES

I am satisfied in nature,

Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most

To my revenge: but in my terms of honour

I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,

Till by some elder masters, of known honour,

I have a voice and precedent of peace,

To keep my name ungored. But till that time,

I do receive your offer'd love like love,

And will not wrong it.


HAMLET

I embrace it freely;

And will this brother's wager frankly play.

Give us the foils. Come on.


LAERTES

Come, one for me.


HAMLET

I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance

Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,

Stick fiery off indeed.


LAERTES

You mock me, sir.


HAMLET

No, by this hand.


KING CLAUDIUS

Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,

You know the wager?


HAMLET

Very well, my lord

Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.


KING CLAUDIUS

I do not fear it; I have seen you both:

But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.


LAERTES

This is too heavy, let me see another.


HAMLET

This likes me well. These foils have all a length?


They prepare to play


OSRIC

Ay, my good lord.


KING CLAUDIUS

Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.

If Hamlet give the first or second hit,

Or quit in answer of the third exchange,

Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:

The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;

And in the cup an union shall he throw,

Richer than that which four successive kings

In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;

And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,

The trumpet to the cannoneer without,

The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,

'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:

And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.


HAMLET

Come on, sir.


LAERTES

                  Come, my lord.


They play


HAMLET

One.


LAERTES

No.


HAMLET

Judgment.


OSRIC

A hit, a very palpable hit.


LAERTES

Well; again.


KING CLAUDIUS

Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;

Here's to thy health.


Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within

Give him the cup.


HAMLET

I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.


They play

Another hit; what say you?


LAERTES

A touch, a touch, I do confess.


KING CLAUDIUS

Our son shall win.


QUEEN GERTRUDE

                  He's fat, and scant of breath.

Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;

The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.


HAMLET

Good madam!


KING CLAUDIUS

          Gertrude, do not drink.


QUEEN GERTRUDE

I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.


KING CLAUDIUS

[Aside]  It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.


HAMLET

I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.


QUEEN GERTRUDE

Come, let me wipe thy face.


LAERTES

My lord, I'll hit him now.


KING CLAUDIUS

I do not think't.


LAERTES

[Aside]  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.


HAMLET

Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;

I pray you, pass with your best violence;

I am afeard you make a wanton of me.


LAERTES

Say you so? come on.


They play


OSRIC

Nothing, neither way.


LAERTES

Have at you now!


LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES


KING CLAUDIUS

Part them; they are incensed.


HAMLET

Nay, come, again.


QUEEN GERTRUDE falls


OSRIC

                  Look to the queen there, ho!


HORATIO

They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?


OSRIC

How is't, Laertes?


LAERTES

Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;

I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.


HAMLET

How does the queen?


KING CLAUDIUS

She swounds to see them bleed.


QUEEN GERTRUDE

No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--

The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.


Dies


HAMLET

O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:

Treachery! Seek it out.


LAERTES

It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;

No medicine in the world can do thee good;

In thee there is not half an hour of life;

The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,

Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise

Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,

Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:

I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.


HAMLET

The point!--envenom'd too!

Then, venom, to thy work.


Stabs KING CLAUDIUS


All

Treason! treason!


KING CLAUDIUS

O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.


HAMLET

Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,

Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?

Follow my mother.


KING CLAUDIUS dies


LAERTES

                  He is justly served;

It is a poison temper'd by himself.

Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:

Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,

Nor thine on me.


Dies


HAMLET

Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.

I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!

You that look pale and tremble at this chance,

That are but mutes or audience to this act,

Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,

Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--

But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;

Thou livest; report me and my cause aright

To the unsatisfied.


HORATIO

Never believe it:

I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:

Here's yet some liquor left.


HAMLET

As thou'rt a man,

Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.

O good Horatio, what a wounded name,

Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!

If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart

Absent thee from felicity awhile,

And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,

To tell my story.


March afar off, and shot within

What warlike noise is this?


OSRIC

Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,

To the ambassadors of England gives

This warlike volley.


HAMLET

O, I die, Horatio;

The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:

I cannot live to hear the news from England;

But I do prophesy the election lights

On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;

So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,

Which have solicited. The rest is silence.


Dies


HORATIO

Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:

And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!

Why does the drum come hither?


March within


Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others


PRINCE FORTINBRAS

Where is this sight?


HORATIO

What is it ye would see?

If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.


PRINCE FORTINBRAS

This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,

What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,

That thou so many princes at a shot

So bloodily hast struck?


First Ambassador

The sight is dismal;

And our affairs from England come too late:

The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,

To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,

That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:

Where should we have our thanks?


HORATIO

Not from his mouth,

Had it the ability of life to thank you:

He never gave commandment for their death.

But since, so jump upon this bloody question,

You from the Polack wars, and you from England,

Are here arrived give order that these bodies

High on a stage be placed to the view;

And let me speak to the yet unknowing world

How these things came about: so shall you hear

Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,

Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,

Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,

And, in this upshot, purposes mistook

Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I

Truly deliver.


PRINCE FORTINBRAS

                  Let us haste to hear it,

And call the noblest to the audience.

For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:

I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,

Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.


HORATIO

Of that I shall have also cause to speak,

And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;

But let this same be presently perform'd,

Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance

On plots and errors, happen.


PRINCE FORTINBRAS

Let four captains

Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;

For he was likely, had he been put on,

To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,

The soldiers' music and the rites of war

Speak loudly for him.

Take up the bodies: such a sight as this

Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.

Go, bid the soldiers shoot.


A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
