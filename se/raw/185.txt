The Tempest: Entire Play





ACT I

SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise


of thunder and lightning heard.



Enter a Master and a Boatswain




Master



Boatswain!




Boatswain



Here, master: what cheer?




Master



Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,


or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.



Exit



Enter Mariners




Boatswain



Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!


yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the


master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,


if room enough!



Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others




ALONSO



Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?


Play the men.




Boatswain



I pray now, keep below.




ANTONIO



Where is the master, boatswain?




Boatswain



Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your


cabins: you do assist the storm.




GONZALO



Nay, good, be patient.




Boatswain



When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers


for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.




GONZALO



Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.




Boatswain



None that I more love than myself. You are a


counsellor; if you can command these elements to


silence, and work the peace of the present, we will


not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you


cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make


yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of


the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out


of our way, I say.



Exit




GONZALO



I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he


hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is


perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his


hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,


for our own doth little advantage. If he be not


born to be hanged, our case is miserable.



Exeunt



Re-enter Boatswain




Boatswain



Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring


her to try with main-course.



A cry within


A plague upon this howling! they are louder than


the weather or our office.



Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO


Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er


and drown? Have you a mind to sink?




SEBASTIAN



A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,


incharitable dog!




Boatswain



Work you then.




ANTONIO



Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!


We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.




GONZALO



I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were


no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an


unstanched wench.




Boatswain



Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to


sea again; lay her off.



Enter Mariners wet




Mariners



All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!




Boatswain



What, must our mouths be cold?




GONZALO



The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,


For our case is as theirs.




SEBASTIAN



I'm out of patience.




ANTONIO



We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:


This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning


The washing of ten tides!




GONZALO



He'll be hang'd yet,


Though every drop of water swear against it


And gape at widest to glut him.



A confused noise within:   'Mercy on us!'--  'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and  children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'




ANTONIO



Let's all sink with the king.




SEBASTIAN



Let's take leave of him.



Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN




GONZALO



Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an


acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any


thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain


die a dry death.



Exeunt



SCENE II. The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.



Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA



MIRANDA



If by your art, my dearest father, you have


Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.


The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,


But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,


Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered


With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,


Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,


Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock


Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.


Had I been any god of power, I would


Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere


It should the good ship so have swallow'd and


The fraughting souls within her.




PROSPERO



Be collected:


No more amazement: tell your piteous heart


There's no harm done.




MIRANDA



O, woe the day!




PROSPERO



No harm.


I have done nothing but in care of thee,


Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who


Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing


Of whence I am, nor that I am more better


Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,


And thy no greater father.




MIRANDA



More to know


Did never meddle with my thoughts.




PROSPERO



'Tis time


I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,


And pluck my magic garment from me. So:



Lays down his mantle


Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.


The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd


The very virtue of compassion in thee,


I have with such provision in mine art


So safely ordered that there is no soul--


No, not so much perdition as an hair


Betid to any creature in the vessel


Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;


For thou must now know farther.




MIRANDA



You have often


Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd


And left me to a bootless inquisition,


Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'




PROSPERO



The hour's now come;


The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;


Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember


A time before we came unto this cell?


I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not


Out three years old.




MIRANDA



Certainly, sir, I can.




PROSPERO



By what? by any other house or person?


Of any thing the image tell me that


Hath kept with thy remembrance.




MIRANDA



'Tis far off


And rather like a dream than an assurance


That my remembrance warrants. Had I not


Four or five women once that tended me?




PROSPERO



Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it


That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else


In the dark backward and abysm of time?


If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,


How thou camest here thou mayst.




MIRANDA



But that I do not.




PROSPERO



Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,


Thy father was the Duke of Milan and


A prince of power.




MIRANDA



Sir, are not you my father?




PROSPERO



Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and


She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father


Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir


And princess no worse issued.




MIRANDA



O the heavens!


What foul play had we, that we came from thence?


Or blessed was't we did?




PROSPERO



Both, both, my girl:


By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,


But blessedly holp hither.




MIRANDA



O, my heart bleeds


To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,


Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.




PROSPERO



My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--


I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should


Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself


Of all the world I loved and to him put


The manage of my state; as at that time


Through all the signories it was the first


And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed


In dignity, and for the liberal arts


Without a parallel; those being all my study,


The government I cast upon my brother


And to my state grew stranger, being transported


And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--


Dost thou attend me?




MIRANDA



Sir, most heedfully.




PROSPERO



Being once perfected how to grant suits,


How to deny them, who to advance and who


To trash for over-topping, new created


The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,


Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key


Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state


To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was


The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,


And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.




MIRANDA



O, good sir, I do.




PROSPERO



I pray thee, mark me.


I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated


To closeness and the bettering of my mind


With that which, but by being so retired,


O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother


Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,


Like a good parent, did beget of him


A falsehood in its contrary as great


As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,


A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,


Not only with what my revenue yielded,


But what my power might else exact, like one


Who having into truth, by telling of it,


Made such a sinner of his memory,


To credit his own lie, he did believe


He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution


And executing the outward face of royalty,


With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--


Dost thou hear?




MIRANDA



Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.




PROSPERO



To have no screen between this part he play'd


And him he play'd it for, he needs will be


Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library


Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties


He thinks me now incapable; confederates--


So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples


To give him annual tribute, do him homage,


Subject his coronet to his crown and bend


The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--


To most ignoble stooping.




MIRANDA



O the heavens!




PROSPERO



Mark his condition and the event; then tell me


If this might be a brother.




MIRANDA



I should sin


To think but nobly of my grandmother:


Good wombs have borne bad sons.




PROSPERO



Now the condition.


The King of Naples, being an enemy


To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;


Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises


Of homage and I know not how much tribute,


Should presently extirpate me and mine


Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan


With all the honours on my brother: whereon,


A treacherous army levied, one midnight


Fated to the purpose did Antonio open


The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,


The ministers for the purpose hurried thence


Me and thy crying self.




MIRANDA



Alack, for pity!


I, not remembering how I cried out then,


Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint


That wrings mine eyes to't.




PROSPERO



Hear a little further


And then I'll bring thee to the present business


Which now's upon's; without the which this story


Were most impertinent.




MIRANDA



Wherefore did they not


That hour destroy us?




PROSPERO



Well demanded, wench:


My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,


So dear the love my people bore me, nor set


A mark so bloody on the business, but


With colours fairer painted their foul ends.


In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,


Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared


A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,


Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats


Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,


To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh


To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,


Did us but loving wrong.




MIRANDA



Alack, what trouble


Was I then to you!




PROSPERO



O, a cherubim


Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.


Infused with a fortitude from heaven,


When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,


Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me


An undergoing stomach, to bear up


Against what should ensue.




MIRANDA



How came we ashore?




PROSPERO



By Providence divine.


Some food we had and some fresh water that


A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,


Out of his charity, being then appointed


Master of this design, did give us, with


Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,


Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,


Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me


From mine own library with volumes that


I prize above my dukedom.




MIRANDA



Would I might


But ever see that man!




PROSPERO



Now I arise:



Resumes his mantle


Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.


Here in this island we arrived; and here


Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit


Than other princesses can that have more time


For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.




MIRANDA



Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,


For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason


For raising this sea-storm?




PROSPERO



Know thus far forth.


By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,


Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies


Brought to this shore; and by my prescience


I find my zenith doth depend upon


A most auspicious star, whose influence


If now I court not but omit, my fortunes


Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:


Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,


And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.



MIRANDA sleeps


Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.


Approach, my Ariel, come.



Enter ARIEL




ARIEL



All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come


To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,


To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride


On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task


Ariel and all his quality.




PROSPERO



Hast thou, spirit,


Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?




ARIEL



To every article.


I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,


Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,


I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,


And burn in many places; on the topmast,


The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,


Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors


O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary


And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks


Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune


Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,


Yea, his dread trident shake.




PROSPERO



My brave spirit!


Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil


Would not infect his reason?




ARIEL



Not a soul


But felt a fever of the mad and play'd


Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners


Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,


Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,


With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--


Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty


And all the devils are here.'




PROSPERO



Why that's my spirit!


But was not this nigh shore?




ARIEL



Close by, my master.




PROSPERO



But are they, Ariel, safe?




ARIEL



Not a hair perish'd;


On their sustaining garments not a blemish,


But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,


In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.


The king's son have I landed by himself;


Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs


In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,


His arms in this sad knot.




PROSPERO



Of the king's ship


The mariners say how thou hast disposed


And all the rest o' the fleet.




ARIEL



Safely in harbour


Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once


Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew


From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:


The mariners all under hatches stow'd;


Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,


I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet


Which I dispersed, they all have met again


And are upon the Mediterranean flote,


Bound sadly home for Naples,


Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd


And his great person perish.




PROSPERO



Ariel, thy charge


Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.


What is the time o' the day?




ARIEL



Past the mid season.




PROSPERO



At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now


Must by us both be spent most preciously.




ARIEL



Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,


Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,


Which is not yet perform'd me.




PROSPERO



How now? moody?


What is't thou canst demand?




ARIEL



My liberty.




PROSPERO



Before the time be out? no more!




ARIEL



I prithee,


Remember I have done thee worthy service;


Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served


Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise


To bate me a full year.




PROSPERO



Dost thou forget


From what a torment I did free thee?




ARIEL



No.




PROSPERO



Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze


Of the salt deep,


To run upon the sharp wind of the north,


To do me business in the veins o' the earth


When it is baked with frost.




ARIEL



I do not, sir.




PROSPERO



Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot


The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy


Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?




ARIEL



No, sir.




PROSPERO



Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.




ARIEL



Sir, in Argier.




PROSPERO



O, was she so? I must


Once in a month recount what thou hast been,


Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,


For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible


To enter human hearing, from Argier,


Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did


They would not take her life. Is not this true?




ARIEL



Ay, sir.




PROSPERO



This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child


And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,


As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;


And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate


To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,


Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,


By help of her more potent ministers


And in her most unmitigable rage,


Into a cloven pine; within which rift


Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain


A dozen years; within which space she died


And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans


As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--


Save for the son that she did litter here,


A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with


A human shape.




ARIEL



Yes, Caliban her son.




PROSPERO



Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban


Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st


What torment I did find thee in; thy groans


Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts


Of ever angry bears: it was a torment


To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax


Could not again undo: it was mine art,


When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape


The pine and let thee out.




ARIEL



I thank thee, master.




PROSPERO



If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak


And peg thee in his knotty entrails till


Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.




ARIEL



Pardon, master;


I will be correspondent to command


And do my spiriting gently.




PROSPERO



Do so, and after two days


I will discharge thee.




ARIEL



That's my noble master!


What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?




PROSPERO



Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject


To no sight but thine and mine, invisible


To every eyeball else. Go take this shape


And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!



Exit ARIEL


Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!




MIRANDA



The strangeness of your story put


Heaviness in me.




PROSPERO



Shake it off. Come on;


We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never


Yields us kind answer.




MIRANDA



'Tis a villain, sir,


I do not love to look on.




PROSPERO



But, as 'tis,


We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,


Fetch in our wood and serves in offices


That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!


Thou earth, thou! speak.




CALIBAN



[Within]  There's wood enough within.




PROSPERO



Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:


Come, thou tortoise! when?



Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph


Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,


Hark in thine ear.




ARIEL



My lord it shall be done.



Exit




PROSPERO



Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself


Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!



Enter CALIBAN




CALIBAN



As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd


With raven's feather from unwholesome fen


Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye


And blister you all o'er!




PROSPERO



For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,


Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins


Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,


All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd


As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging


Than bees that made 'em.




CALIBAN



I must eat my dinner.


This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,


Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,


Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me


Water with berries in't, and teach me how


To name the bigger light, and how the less,


That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee


And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,


The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:


Cursed be I that did so! All the charms


Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!


For I am all the subjects that you have,


Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me


In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me


The rest o' the island.




PROSPERO



Thou most lying slave,


Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,


Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee


In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate


The honour of my child.




CALIBAN



O ho, O ho! would't had been done!


Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else


This isle with Calibans.




PROSPERO



Abhorred slave,


Which any print of goodness wilt not take,


Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,


Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour


One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,


Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like


A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes


With words that made them known. But thy vile race,


Though thou didst learn, had that in't which


good natures


Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou


Deservedly confined into this rock,


Who hadst deserved more than a prison.




CALIBAN



You taught me language; and my profit on't


Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you


For learning me your language!




PROSPERO



Hag-seed, hence!


Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,


To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?


If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly


What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,


Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar


That beasts shall tremble at thy din.




CALIBAN



No, pray thee.



Aside


I must obey: his art is of such power,


It would control my dam's god, Setebos,


and make a vassal of him.




PROSPERO



So, slave; hence!



Exit CALIBAN



Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND following


ARIEL'S song.


Come unto these yellow sands,


And then take hands:


Courtsied when you have and kiss'd


The wild waves whist,


Foot it featly here and there;


And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.


Hark, hark!



Burthen [dispersedly, within


The watch-dogs bark!



Burthen Bow-wow


Hark, hark! I hear


The strain of strutting chanticleer


Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.




FERDINAND



Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?


It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon


Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,


Weeping again the king my father's wreck,


This music crept by me upon the waters,


Allaying both their fury and my passion


With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,


Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.


No, it begins again.



ARIEL sings


Full fathom five thy father lies;


Of his bones are coral made;


Those are pearls that were his eyes:


Nothing of him that doth fade


But doth suffer a sea-change


Into something rich and strange.


Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell



Burthen Ding-dong


Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.




FERDINAND



The ditty does remember my drown'd father.


This is no mortal business, nor no sound


That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.




PROSPERO



The fringed curtains of thine eye advance


And say what thou seest yond.




MIRANDA



What is't? a spirit?


Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,


It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.




PROSPERO



No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses


As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest


Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd


With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him


A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows


And strays about to find 'em.




MIRANDA



I might call him


A thing divine, for nothing natural


I ever saw so noble.




PROSPERO



[Aside] It goes on, I see,


As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee


Within two days for this.




FERDINAND



Most sure, the goddess


On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer


May know if you remain upon this island;


And that you will some good instruction give


How I may bear me here: my prime request,


Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!


If you be maid or no?




MIRANDA



No wonder, sir;


But certainly a maid.




FERDINAND



My language! heavens!


I am the best of them that speak this speech,


Were I but where 'tis spoken.




PROSPERO



How? the best?


What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?




FERDINAND



A single thing, as I am now, that wonders


To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;


And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,


Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld


The king my father wreck'd.




MIRANDA



Alack, for mercy!




FERDINAND



Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan


And his brave son being twain.




PROSPERO



[Aside]	The Duke of Milan


And his more braver daughter could control thee,


If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight


They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,


I'll set thee free for this.



To FERDINAND


A word, good sir;


I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.




MIRANDA



Why speaks my father so ungently? This


Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first


That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father


To be inclined my way!




FERDINAND



O, if a virgin,


And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you


The queen of Naples.




PROSPERO



Soft, sir! one word more.



Aside


They are both in either's powers; but this swift business


I must uneasy make, lest too light winning


Make the prize light.



To FERDINAND


One word more; I charge thee


That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp


The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself


Upon this island as a spy, to win it


From me, the lord on't.




FERDINAND



No, as I am a man.




MIRANDA



There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:


If the ill spirit have so fair a house,


Good things will strive to dwell with't.




PROSPERO



Follow me.


Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;


I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:


Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be


The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks


Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.




FERDINAND



No;


I will resist such entertainment till


Mine enemy has more power.



Draws, and is charmed from moving




MIRANDA



O dear father,


Make not too rash a trial of him, for


He's gentle and not fearful.




PROSPERO



What? I say,


My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;


Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience


Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,


For I can here disarm thee with this stick


And make thy weapon drop.




MIRANDA



Beseech you, father.




PROSPERO



Hence! hang not on my garments.




MIRANDA



Sir, have pity;


I'll be his surety.




PROSPERO



Silence! one word more


Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!


An advocate for an imposter! hush!


Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,


Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!


To the most of men this is a Caliban


And they to him are angels.




MIRANDA



My affections


Are then most humble; I have no ambition


To see a goodlier man.




PROSPERO



Come on; obey:


Thy nerves are in their infancy again


And have no vigour in them.




FERDINAND



So they are;


My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.


My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,


The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,


To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,


Might I but through my prison once a day


Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth


Let liberty make use of; space enough


Have I in such a prison.




PROSPERO



[Aside]                It works.



To FERDINAND


Come on.


Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!



To FERDINAND


Follow me.



To ARIEL


Hark what thou else shalt do me.




MIRANDA



Be of comfort;


My father's of a better nature, sir,


Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted


Which now came from him.




PROSPERO



Thou shalt be free


As mountain winds: but then exactly do


All points of my command.




ARIEL



To the syllable.




PROSPERO



Come, follow. Speak not for him.



Exeunt




ACT II

SCENE I. Another part of the island.



Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others



GONZALO



Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,


So have we all, of joy; for our escape


Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe


Is common; every day some sailor's wife,


The masters of some merchant and the merchant


Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,


I mean our preservation, few in millions


Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh


Our sorrow with our comfort.




ALONSO



Prithee, peace.




SEBASTIAN



He receives comfort like cold porridge.




ANTONIO



The visitor will not give him o'er so.




SEBASTIAN



Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;


by and by it will strike.




GONZALO



Sir,--




SEBASTIAN



One: tell.




GONZALO



When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,


Comes to the entertainer--




SEBASTIAN



A dollar.




GONZALO



Dolour comes to him, indeed: you


have spoken truer than you purposed.




SEBASTIAN



You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.




GONZALO



Therefore, my lord,--




ANTONIO



Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!




ALONSO



I prithee, spare.




GONZALO



Well, I have done: but yet,--




SEBASTIAN



He will be talking.




ANTONIO



Which, of he or Adrian, for a good


wager, first begins to crow?




SEBASTIAN



The old cock.




ANTONIO



The cockerel.




SEBASTIAN



Done. The wager?




ANTONIO



A laughter.




SEBASTIAN



A match!




ADRIAN



Though this island seem to be desert,--




SEBASTIAN



Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.




ADRIAN



Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--




SEBASTIAN



Yet,--




ADRIAN



Yet,--




ANTONIO



He could not miss't.




ADRIAN



It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate


temperance.




ANTONIO



Temperance was a delicate wench.




SEBASTIAN



Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.




ADRIAN



The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.




SEBASTIAN



As if it had lungs and rotten ones.




ANTONIO



Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.




GONZALO



Here is everything advantageous to life.




ANTONIO



True; save means to live.




SEBASTIAN



Of that there's none, or little.




GONZALO



How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!




ANTONIO



The ground indeed is tawny.




SEBASTIAN



With an eye of green in't.




ANTONIO



He misses not much.




SEBASTIAN



No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.




GONZALO



But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost


beyond credit,--




SEBASTIAN



As many vouched rarities are.




GONZALO



That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in


the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and


glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with


salt water.




ANTONIO



If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not


say he lies?




SEBASTIAN



Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report




GONZALO



Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we


put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of


the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.




SEBASTIAN



'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.




ADRIAN



Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to


their queen.




GONZALO



Not since widow Dido's time.




ANTONIO



Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?


widow Dido!




SEBASTIAN



What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,


how you take it!




ADRIAN



'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:


she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.




GONZALO



This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.




ADRIAN



Carthage?




GONZALO



I assure you, Carthage.




SEBASTIAN



His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath


raised the wall and houses too.




ANTONIO



What impossible matter will he make easy next?




SEBASTIAN



I think he will carry this island home in his pocket


and give it his son for an apple.




ANTONIO



And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring


forth more islands.




GONZALO



Ay.




ANTONIO



Why, in good time.




GONZALO



Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now


as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage


of your daughter, who is now queen.




ANTONIO



And the rarest that e'er came there.




SEBASTIAN



Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.




ANTONIO



O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.




GONZALO



Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I


wore it? I mean, in a sort.




ANTONIO



That sort was well fished for.




GONZALO



When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?




ALONSO



You cram these words into mine ears against


The stomach of my sense. Would I had never


Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,


My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,


Who is so far from Italy removed


I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir


Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish


Hath made his meal on thee?




FRANCISCO



Sir, he may live:


I saw him beat the surges under him,


And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,


Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted


The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head


'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd


Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke


To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,


As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt


He came alive to land.




ALONSO



No, no, he's gone.




SEBASTIAN



Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,


That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,


But rather lose her to an African;


Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,


Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.




ALONSO



Prithee, peace.




SEBASTIAN



You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise


By all of us, and the fair soul herself


Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at


Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your


son,


I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have


More widows in them of this business' making


Than we bring men to comfort them:


The fault's your own.




ALONSO



So is the dear'st o' the loss.




GONZALO



My lord Sebastian,


The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness


And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,


When you should bring the plaster.




SEBASTIAN



Very well.




ANTONIO



And most chirurgeonly.




GONZALO



It is foul weather in us all, good sir,


When you are cloudy.




SEBASTIAN



Foul weather?




ANTONIO



Very foul.




GONZALO



Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--




ANTONIO



He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.




SEBASTIAN



Or docks, or mallows.




GONZALO



And were the king on't, what would I do?




SEBASTIAN



'Scape being drunk for want of wine.




GONZALO



I' the commonwealth I would by contraries


Execute all things; for no kind of traffic


Would I admit; no name of magistrate;


Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,


And use of service, none; contract, succession,


Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;


No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;


No occupation; all men idle, all;


And women too, but innocent and pure;


No sovereignty;--




SEBASTIAN



Yet he would be king on't.




ANTONIO



The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the


beginning.




GONZALO



All things in common nature should produce


Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,


Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,


Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,


Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,


To feed my innocent people.




SEBASTIAN



No marrying 'mong his subjects?




ANTONIO



None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.




GONZALO



I would with such perfection govern, sir,


To excel the golden age.




SEBASTIAN



God save his majesty!




ANTONIO



Long live Gonzalo!




GONZALO



And,--do you mark me, sir?




ALONSO



Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.




GONZALO



I do well believe your highness; and


did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,


who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that


they always use to laugh at nothing.




ANTONIO



'Twas you we laughed at.




GONZALO



Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing


to you: so you may continue and laugh at


nothing still.




ANTONIO



What a blow was there given!




SEBASTIAN



An it had not fallen flat-long.




GONZALO



You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift


the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue


in it five weeks without changing.



Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music




SEBASTIAN



We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.




ANTONIO



Nay, good my lord, be not angry.




GONZALO



No, I warrant you; I will not adventure


my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh


me asleep, for I am very heavy?




ANTONIO



Go sleep, and hear us.



All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO




ALONSO



What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes


Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find


They are inclined to do so.




SEBASTIAN



Please you, sir,


Do not omit the heavy offer of it:


It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,


It is a comforter.




ANTONIO



We two, my lord,


Will guard your person while you take your rest,


And watch your safety.




ALONSO



Thank you. Wondrous heavy.



ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL




SEBASTIAN



What a strange drowsiness possesses them!




ANTONIO



It is the quality o' the climate.




SEBASTIAN



Why


Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not


Myself disposed to sleep.




ANTONIO



Nor I; my spirits are nimble.


They fell together all, as by consent;


They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,


Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--


And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,


What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and


My strong imagination sees a crown


Dropping upon thy head.




SEBASTIAN



What, art thou waking?




ANTONIO



Do you not hear me speak?




SEBASTIAN



I do; and surely


It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st


Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?


This is a strange repose, to be asleep


With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,


And yet so fast asleep.




ANTONIO



Noble Sebastian,


Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st


Whiles thou art waking.




SEBASTIAN



Thou dost snore distinctly;


There's meaning in thy snores.




ANTONIO



I am more serious than my custom: you


Must be so too, if heed me; which to do


Trebles thee o'er.




SEBASTIAN



Well, I am standing water.




ANTONIO



I'll teach you how to flow.




SEBASTIAN



Do so: to ebb


Hereditary sloth instructs me.




ANTONIO



O,


If you but knew how you the purpose cherish


Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,


You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,


Most often do so near the bottom run


By their own fear or sloth.




SEBASTIAN



Prithee, say on:


The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim


A matter from thee, and a birth indeed


Which throes thee much to yield.




ANTONIO



Thus, sir:


Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,


Who shall be of as little memory


When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--


For he's a spirit of persuasion, only


Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,


'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd


And he that sleeps here swims.




SEBASTIAN



I have no hope


That he's undrown'd.




ANTONIO



O, out of that 'no hope'


What great hope have you! no hope that way is


Another way so high a hope that even


Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,


But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me


That Ferdinand is drown'd?




SEBASTIAN



He's gone.




ANTONIO



Then, tell me,


Who's the next heir of Naples?




SEBASTIAN



Claribel.




ANTONIO



She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells


Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples


Can have no note, unless the sun were post--


The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins


Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?


We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,


And by that destiny to perform an act


Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come


In yours and my discharge.




SEBASTIAN



What stuff is this! how say you?


'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;


So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions


There is some space.




ANTONIO



A space whose every cubit


Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel


Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,


And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death


That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse


Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples


As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate


As amply and unnecessarily


As this Gonzalo; I myself could make


A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore


The mind that I do! what a sleep were this


For your advancement! Do you understand me?




SEBASTIAN



Methinks I do.




ANTONIO



And how does your content


Tender your own good fortune?




SEBASTIAN



I remember


You did supplant your brother Prospero.




ANTONIO



True:


And look how well my garments sit upon me;


Much feater than before: my brother's servants


Were then my fellows; now they are my men.




SEBASTIAN



But, for your conscience?




ANTONIO



Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,


'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not


This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,


That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they


And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,


No better than the earth he lies upon,


If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;


Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,


Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,


To the perpetual wink for aye might put


This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who


Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,


They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;


They'll tell the clock to any business that


We say befits the hour.




SEBASTIAN



Thy case, dear friend,


Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,


I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke


Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;


And I the king shall love thee.




ANTONIO



Draw together;


And when I rear my hand, do you the like,


To fall it on Gonzalo.




SEBASTIAN



O, but one word.



They talk apart



Re-enter ARIEL, invisible




ARIEL



My master through his art foresees the danger


That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--


For else his project dies--to keep them living.



Sings in GONZALO's ear


While you here do snoring lie,


Open-eyed conspiracy


His time doth take.


If of life you keep a care,


Shake off slumber, and beware:


Awake, awake!




ANTONIO



Then let us both be sudden.




GONZALO



Now, good angels


Preserve the king.



They wake




ALONSO



Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?


Wherefore this ghastly looking?




GONZALO



What's the matter?




SEBASTIAN



Whiles we stood here securing your repose,


Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing


Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?


It struck mine ear most terribly.




ALONSO



I heard nothing.




ANTONIO



O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,


To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar


Of a whole herd of lions.




ALONSO



Heard you this, Gonzalo?




GONZALO



Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,


And that a strange one too, which did awake me:


I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,


I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,


That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,


Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.




ALONSO



Lead off this ground; and let's make further search


For my poor son.




GONZALO



Heavens keep him from these beasts!


For he is, sure, i' the island.




ALONSO



Lead away.




ARIEL



Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:


So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.



Exeunt



SCENE II. Another part of the island.



Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard



CALIBAN



All the infections that the sun sucks up


From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him


By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me


And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,


Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,


Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark


Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but


For every trifle are they set upon me;


Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me


And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which


Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount


Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I


All wound with adders who with cloven tongues


Do hiss me into madness.



Enter TRINCULO


Lo, now, lo!


Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me


For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;


Perchance he will not mind me.




TRINCULO



Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off


any weather at all, and another storm brewing;


I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black


cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul


bombard that would shed his liquor. If it


should thunder as it did before, I know not


where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot


choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we


here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:


he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-


like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-


John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,


as once I was, and had but this fish painted,


not a holiday fool there but would give a piece


of silver: there would this monster make a


man; any strange beast there makes a man:


when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame


beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead


Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like


arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose


my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,


but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a


thunderbolt.



Thunder


Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to


creep under his gaberdine; there is no other


shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with


strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the


dregs of the storm be past.



Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand




STEPHANO



I shall no more to sea, to sea,


Here shall I die ashore--


This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's


funeral: well, here's my comfort.



Drinks



Sings


The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,


The gunner and his mate


Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,


But none of us cared for Kate;


For she had a tongue with a tang,


Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!


She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,


Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:


Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!


This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.



Drinks




CALIBAN



Do not torment me: Oh!




STEPHANO



What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put


tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I


have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your


four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as


ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;


and it shall be said so again while Stephano


breathes at's nostrils.




CALIBAN



The spirit torments me; Oh!




STEPHANO



This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who


hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil


should he learn our language? I will give him some


relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him


and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a


present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.




CALIBAN



Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.




STEPHANO



He's in his fit now and does not talk after the


wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have


never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his


fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will


not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that


hath him, and that soundly.




CALIBAN



Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I


know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.




STEPHANO



Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that


which will give language to you, cat: open your


mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,


and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:


open your chaps again.




TRINCULO



I should know that voice: it should be--but he is


drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!




STEPHANO



Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!


His forward voice now is to speak well of his


friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches


and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will


recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I


will pour some in thy other mouth.




TRINCULO



Stephano!




STEPHANO



Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is


a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no


long spoon.




TRINCULO



Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and


speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy


good friend Trinculo.




STEPHANO



If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee


by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,


these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How


camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can


he vent Trinculos?




TRINCULO



I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But


art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art


not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me


under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of


the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O


Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!




STEPHANO



Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.




CALIBAN



[Aside]  These be fine things, an if they be


not sprites.


That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.


I will kneel to him.




STEPHANO



How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?


swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I


escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors


heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of


the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was


cast ashore.




CALIBAN



I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;


for the liquor is not earthly.




STEPHANO



Here; swear then how thou escapedst.




TRINCULO



Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a


duck, I'll be sworn.




STEPHANO



Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a


duck, thou art made like a goose.




TRINCULO



O Stephano. hast any more of this?




STEPHANO



The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the


sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!


how does thine ague?




CALIBAN



Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?




STEPHANO



Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'


the moon when time was.




CALIBAN



I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:


My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.




STEPHANO



Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish


it anon with new contents swear.




TRINCULO



By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!


I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'


the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well


drawn, monster, in good sooth!




CALIBAN



I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;


And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.




TRINCULO



By this light, a most perfidious and drunken


monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.




CALIBAN



I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.




STEPHANO



Come on then; down, and swear.




TRINCULO



I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed


monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my


heart to beat him,--




STEPHANO



Come, kiss.




TRINCULO



But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!




CALIBAN



I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;


I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.


A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!


I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,


Thou wondrous man.




TRINCULO



A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a


Poor drunkard!




CALIBAN



I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;


And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;


Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how


To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee


To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee


Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?




STEPHANO



I prithee now, lead the way without any more


talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company


else being drowned, we will inherit here: here;


bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by


and by again.




CALIBAN



[Sings drunkenly]


Farewell master; farewell, farewell!




TRINCULO



A howling monster: a drunken monster!




CALIBAN



No more dams I'll make for fish


Nor fetch in firing


At requiring;


Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish


'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban


Has a new master: get a new man.


Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,


hey-day, freedom!




STEPHANO



O brave monster! Lead the way.



Exeunt




ACT III

SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S Cell.



Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log



FERDINAND



There be some sports are painful, and their labour


Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness


Are nobly undergone and most poor matters


Point to rich ends. This my mean task


Would be as heavy to me as odious, but


The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead


And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is


Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,


And he's composed of harshness. I must remove


Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,


Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress


Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness


Had never like executor. I forget:


But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,


Most busy lest, when I do it.



Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen




MIRANDA



Alas, now, pray you,


Work not so hard: I would the lightning had


Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!


Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,


'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father


Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;


He's safe for these three hours.




FERDINAND



O most dear mistress,


The sun will set before I shall discharge


What I must strive to do.




MIRANDA



If you'll sit down,


I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;


I'll carry it to the pile.




FERDINAND



No, precious creature;


I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,


Than you should such dishonour undergo,


While I sit lazy by.




MIRANDA



It would become me


As well as it does you: and I should do it


With much more ease; for my good will is to it,


And yours it is against.




PROSPERO



Poor worm, thou art infected!


This visitation shows it.




MIRANDA



You look wearily.




FERDINAND



No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me


When you are by at night. I do beseech you--


Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--


What is your name?




MIRANDA



Miranda.--O my father,


I have broke your hest to say so!




FERDINAND



Admired Miranda!


Indeed the top of admiration! worth


What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady


I have eyed with best regard and many a time


The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage


Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues


Have I liked several women; never any


With so fun soul, but some defect in her


Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed


And put it to the foil: but you, O you,


So perfect and so peerless, are created


Of every creature's best!




MIRANDA



I do not know


One of my sex; no woman's face remember,


Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen


More that I may call men than you, good friend,


And my dear father: how features are abroad,


I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,


The jewel in my dower, I would not wish


Any companion in the world but you,


Nor can imagination form a shape,


Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle


Something too wildly and my father's precepts


I therein do forget.




FERDINAND



I am in my condition


A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;


I would, not so!--and would no more endure


This wooden slavery than to suffer


The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:


The very instant that I saw you, did


My heart fly to your service; there resides,


To make me slave to it; and for your sake


Am I this patient log--man.




MIRANDA



Do you love me?




FERDINAND



O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound


And crown what I profess with kind event


If I speak true! if hollowly, invert


What best is boded me to mischief! I


Beyond all limit of what else i' the world


Do love, prize, honour you.




MIRANDA



I am a fool


To weep at what I am glad of.




PROSPERO



Fair encounter


Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace


On that which breeds between 'em!




FERDINAND



Wherefore weep you?




MIRANDA



At mine unworthiness that dare not offer


What I desire to give, and much less take


What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;


And all the more it seeks to hide itself,


The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!


And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!


I am your wife, if you will marry me;


If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow


You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,


Whether you will or no.




FERDINAND



My mistress, dearest;


And I thus humble ever.




MIRANDA



My husband, then?




FERDINAND



Ay, with a heart as willing


As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.




MIRANDA



And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell


Till half an hour hence.




FERDINAND



A thousand thousand!



Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally




PROSPERO



So glad of this as they I cannot be,


Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing


At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,


For yet ere supper-time must I perform


Much business appertaining.



Exit



SCENE II. Another part of the island.



Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO



STEPHANO



Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink


water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and


board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.




TRINCULO



Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They


say there's but five upon this isle: we are three


of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the


state totters.




STEPHANO



Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes


are almost set in thy head.




TRINCULO



Where should they be set else? he were a brave


monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.




STEPHANO



My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:


for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I


could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off


and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,


monster, or my standard.




TRINCULO



Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.




STEPHANO



We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.




TRINCULO



Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say


nothing neither.




STEPHANO



Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a


good moon-calf.




CALIBAN



How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.


I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.




TRINCULO



Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to


justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,


was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much


sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,


being but half a fish and half a monster?




CALIBAN



Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?




TRINCULO



'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!




CALIBAN



Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.




STEPHANO



Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you


prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's


my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.




CALIBAN



I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to


hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?




STEPHANO



Marry, will I	kneel and repeat it; I will stand,


and so shall Trinculo.



Enter ARIEL, invisible




CALIBAN



As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a


sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.




ARIEL



Thou liest.




CALIBAN



Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my


valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.




STEPHANO



Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by


this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.




TRINCULO



Why, I said nothing.




STEPHANO



Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.




CALIBAN



I say, by sorcery he got this isle;


From me he got it. if thy greatness will


Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,


But this thing dare not,--




STEPHANO



That's most certain.




CALIBAN



Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.




STEPHANO



How now shall this be compassed?


Canst thou bring me to the party?




CALIBAN



Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,


Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.




ARIEL



Thou liest; thou canst not.




CALIBAN



What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!


I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows


And take his bottle from him: when that's gone


He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him


Where the quick freshes are.




STEPHANO



Trinculo, run into no further danger:


interrupt the monster one word further, and,


by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors


and make a stock-fish of thee.




TRINCULO



Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther


off.




STEPHANO



Didst thou not say he lied?




ARIEL



Thou liest.




STEPHANO



Do I so? take thou that.



Beats TRINCULO


As you like this, give me the lie another time.




TRINCULO



I did not give the lie. Out o' your


wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!


this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on


your monster, and the devil take your fingers!




CALIBAN



Ha, ha, ha!




STEPHANO



Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther


off.




CALIBAN



Beat him enough: after a little time


I'll beat him too.




STEPHANO



Stand farther. Come, proceed.




CALIBAN



Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,


I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,


Having first seized his books, or with a log


Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,


Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember


First to possess his books; for without them


He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not


One spirit to command: they all do hate him


As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.


He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--


Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal


And that most deeply to consider is


The beauty of his daughter; he himself


Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,


But only Sycorax my dam and she;


But she as far surpasseth Sycorax


As great'st does least.




STEPHANO



Is it so brave a lass?




CALIBAN



Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.


And bring thee forth brave brood.




STEPHANO



Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I


will be king and queen--save our graces!--and


Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou


like the plot, Trinculo?




TRINCULO



Excellent.




STEPHANO



Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,


while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.




CALIBAN



Within this half hour will he be asleep:


Wilt thou destroy him then?




STEPHANO



Ay, on mine honour.




ARIEL



This will I tell my master.




CALIBAN



Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:


Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch


You taught me but while-ere?




STEPHANO



At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any


reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.



Sings


Flout 'em and scout 'em


And scout 'em and flout 'em


Thought is free.




CALIBAN



That's not the tune.



Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe




STEPHANO



What is this same?




TRINCULO



This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture


of Nobody.




STEPHANO



If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:


if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.




TRINCULO



O, forgive me my sins!




STEPHANO



He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!




CALIBAN



Art thou afeard?




STEPHANO



No, monster, not I.




CALIBAN



Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,


Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.


Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments


Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices


That, if I then had waked after long sleep,


Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,


The clouds methought would open and show riches


Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,


I cried to dream again.




STEPHANO



This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall


have my music for nothing.




CALIBAN



When Prospero is destroyed.




STEPHANO



That shall be by and by: I remember the story.




TRINCULO



The sound is going away; let's follow it, and


after do our work.




STEPHANO



Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see


this tabourer; he lays it on.




TRINCULO



Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.



Exeunt



SCENE III. Another part of the island.



Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others



GONZALO



By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;


My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed


Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,


I needs must rest me.




ALONSO



Old lord, I cannot blame thee,


Who am myself attach'd with weariness,


To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.


Even here I will put off my hope and keep it


No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd


Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks


Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.




ANTONIO



[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's so


out of hope.


Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose


That you resolved to effect.




SEBASTIAN



[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage


Will we take throughly.




ANTONIO



[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night;


For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they


Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance


As when they are fresh.




SEBASTIAN



[Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night: no more.



Solemn and strange music




ALONSO



What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!




GONZALO



Marvellous sweet music!



Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several  strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;  they dance about it with gentle actions of  salutation; and, inviting the King,  & c. to eat, they depart




ALONSO



Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?




SEBASTIAN



A living drollery. Now I will believe


That there are unicorns, that in Arabia


There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix


At this hour reigning there.




ANTONIO



I'll believe both;


And what does else want credit, come to me,


And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did


lie,


Though fools at home condemn 'em.




GONZALO



If in Naples


I should report this now, would they believe me?


If I should say, I saw such islanders--


For, certes, these are people of the island--


Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,


Their manners are more gentle-kind than of


Our human generation you shall find


Many, nay, almost any.




PROSPERO



[Aside]              Honest lord,


Thou hast said well; for some of you there present


Are worse than devils.




ALONSO



I cannot too much muse


Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,


Although they want the use of tongue, a kind


Of excellent dumb discourse.




PROSPERO



[Aside]	Praise in departing.




FRANCISCO



They vanish'd strangely.




SEBASTIAN



No matter, since


They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.


Will't please you taste of what is here?




ALONSO



Not I.




GONZALO



Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,


Who would believe that there were mountaineers


Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em


Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men


Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find


Each putter-out of five for one will bring us


Good warrant of.




ALONSO



I will stand to and feed,


Although my last: no matter, since I feel


The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,


Stand to and do as we.



Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a  harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes




ARIEL



You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,


That hath to instrument this lower world


And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea


Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island


Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men


Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;


And even with such-like valour men hang and drown


Their proper selves.



ALONSO, SEBASTIAN  & c. draw their swords


You fools! I and my fellows


Are ministers of Fate: the elements,


Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well


Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs


Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish


One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers


Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,


Your swords are now too massy for your strengths


And will not be uplifted. But remember--


For that's my business to you--that you three


From Milan did supplant good Prospero;


Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,


Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed


The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have


Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,


Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,


They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:


Lingering perdition, worse than any death


Can be at once, shall step by step attend


You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--


Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls


Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow


And a clear life ensuing.



He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music  enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table




PROSPERO



Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou


Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:


Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated


In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life


And observation strange, my meaner ministers


Their several kinds have done. My high charms work


And these mine enemies are all knit up


In their distractions; they now are in my power;


And in these fits I leave them, while I visit


Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,


And his and mine loved darling.



Exit above




GONZALO



I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you


In this strange stare?




ALONSO



O, it is monstrous, monstrous:


Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;


The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,


That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced


The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.


Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and


I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded


And with him there lie mudded.



Exit




SEBASTIAN



But one fiend at a time,


I'll fight their legions o'er.




ANTONIO



I'll be thy second.



Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO




GONZALO



All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,


Like poison given to work a great time after,


Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you


That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly


And hinder them from what this ecstasy


May now provoke them to.




ADRIAN



Follow, I pray you.



Exeunt




ACT IV

SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.



Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA



PROSPERO



If I have too austerely punish'd you,


Your compensation makes amends, for I


Have given you here a third of mine own life,


Or that for which I live; who once again


I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations


Were but my trials of thy love and thou


Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,


I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,


Do not smile at me that I boast her off,


For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise


And make it halt behind her.




FERDINAND



I do believe it


Against an oracle.




PROSPERO



Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition


Worthily purchased take my daughter: but


If thou dost break her virgin-knot before


All sanctimonious ceremonies may


With full and holy rite be minister'd,


No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall


To make this contract grow: but barren hate,


Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew


The union of your bed with weeds so loathly


That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,


As Hymen's lamps shall light you.




FERDINAND



As I hope


For quiet days, fair issue and long life,


With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,


The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.


Our worser genius can, shall never melt


Mine honour into lust, to take away


The edge of that day's celebration


When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,


Or Night kept chain'd below.




PROSPERO



Fairly spoke.


Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.


What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!



Enter ARIEL




ARIEL



What would my potent master? here I am.




PROSPERO



Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service


Did worthily perform; and I must use you


In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,


O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:


Incite them to quick motion; for I must


Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple


Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,


And they expect it from me.




ARIEL



Presently?




PROSPERO



Ay, with a twink.




ARIEL



Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'


And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'


Each one, tripping on his toe,


Will be here with mop and mow.


Do you love me, master? no?




PROSPERO



Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach


Till thou dost hear me call.




ARIEL



Well, I conceive.



Exit




PROSPERO



Look thou be true; do not give dalliance


Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw


To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,


Or else, good night your vow!




FERDINAND



I warrant you sir;


The white cold virgin snow upon my heart


Abates the ardour of my liver.




PROSPERO



Well.


Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,


Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!


No tongue! all eyes! be silent.



Soft music



Enter IRIS




IRIS



Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas


Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;


Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,


And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;


Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,


Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,


To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,


Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,


Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;


And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,


Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,


Whose watery arch and messenger am I,


Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,


Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,


To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:


Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.



Enter CERES




CERES



Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er


Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;


Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers


Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,


And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown


My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,


Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen


Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?




IRIS



A contract of true love to celebrate;


And some donation freely to estate


On the blest lovers.




CERES



Tell me, heavenly bow,


If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,


Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot


The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,


Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company


I have forsworn.




IRIS



Of her society


Be not afraid: I met her deity


Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son


Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done


Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,


Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid


Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;


Mars's hot minion is returned again;


Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,


Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows


And be a boy right out.




CERES



High'st queen of state,


Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.



Enter JUNO




JUNO



How does my bounteous sister? Go with me


To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be


And honour'd in their issue.



They sing:




JUNO



Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,


Long continuance, and increasing,


Hourly joys be still upon you!


Juno sings her blessings upon you.




CERES



Earth's increase, foison plenty,


Barns and garners never empty,


Vines and clustering bunches growing,


Plants with goodly burthen bowing;


Spring come to you at the farthest


In the very end of harvest!


Scarcity and want shall shun you;


Ceres' blessing so is on you.




FERDINAND



This is a most majestic vision, and


Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold


To think these spirits?




PROSPERO



Spirits, which by mine art


I have from their confines call'd to enact


My present fancies.




FERDINAND



Let me live here ever;


So rare a wonder'd father and a wife


Makes this place Paradise.



Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment




PROSPERO



Sweet, now, silence!


Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;


There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,


Or else our spell is marr'd.




IRIS



You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,


With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,


Leave your crisp channels and on this green land


Answer your summons; Juno does command:


Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate


A contract of true love; be not too late.



Enter certain Nymphs


You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,


Come hither from the furrow and be merry:


Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on


And these fresh nymphs encounter every one


In country footing.



Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they  join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance;  towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts  suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a  strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish




PROSPERO



[Aside]  I had forgot that foul conspiracy


Of the beast Caliban and his confederates


Against my life: the minute of their plot


Is almost come.



To the Spirits


Well done! avoid; no more!




FERDINAND



This is strange: your father's in some passion


That works him strongly.




MIRANDA



Never till this day


Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.




PROSPERO



You do look, my son, in a moved sort,


As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.


Our revels now are ended. These our actors,


As I foretold you, were all spirits and


Are melted into air, into thin air:


And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,


The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,


The solemn temples, the great globe itself,


Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve


And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,


Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff


As dreams are made on, and our little life


Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;


Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:


Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:


If you be pleased, retire into my cell


And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,


To still my beating mind.




FERDINAND



MIRANDA



We wish your peace.



Exeunt




PROSPERO



Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.



Enter ARIEL




ARIEL



Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?




PROSPERO



Spirit,


We must prepare to meet with Caliban.




ARIEL



Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,


I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd


Lest I might anger thee.




PROSPERO



Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?




ARIEL



I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;


So fun of valour that they smote the air


For breathing in their faces; beat the ground


For kissing of their feet; yet always bending


Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;


At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd


their ears,


Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses


As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears


That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through


Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,


Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them


I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,


There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake


O'erstunk their feet.




PROSPERO



This was well done, my bird.


Thy shape invisible retain thou still:


The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,


For stale to catch these thieves.




ARIEL



I go, I go.



Exit




PROSPERO



A devil, a born devil, on whose nature


Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,


Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;


And as with age his body uglier grows,


So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,


Even to roaring.



Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel,  & c


Come, hang them on this line.



PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet




CALIBAN



Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not


Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.




STEPHANO



Monster, your fairy, which you say is


a harmless fairy, has done little better than


played the Jack with us.




TRINCULO



Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at


which my nose is in great indignation.




STEPHANO



So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take


a displeasure against you, look you,--




TRINCULO



Thou wert but a lost monster.




CALIBAN



Good my lord, give me thy favour still.


Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to


Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.


All's hush'd as midnight yet.




TRINCULO



Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--




STEPHANO



There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,


monster, but an infinite loss.




TRINCULO



That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your


harmless fairy, monster.




STEPHANO



I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears


for my labour.




CALIBAN



Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,


This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.


Do that good mischief which may make this island


Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,


For aye thy foot-licker.




STEPHANO



Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.




TRINCULO



O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look


what a wardrobe here is for thee!




CALIBAN



Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.




TRINCULO



O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.


O king Stephano!




STEPHANO



Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have


that gown.




TRINCULO



Thy grace shall have it.




CALIBAN



The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean


To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone


And do the murder first: if he awake,


From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,


Make us strange stuff.




STEPHANO



Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,


is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under


the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your


hair and prove a bald jerkin.




TRINCULO



Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.




STEPHANO



I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:


wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this


country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent


pass of pate; there's another garment for't.




TRINCULO



Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and


away with the rest.




CALIBAN



I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,


And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes


With foreheads villanous low.




STEPHANO



Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this


away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you


out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.




TRINCULO



And this.




STEPHANO



Ay, and this.



A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,  in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on




PROSPERO



Hey, Mountain, hey!




ARIEL



Silver I there it goes, Silver!




PROSPERO



Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!



CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are driven out


Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints


With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews


With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them


Than pard or cat o' mountain.




ARIEL



Hark, they roar!




PROSPERO



Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour


Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:


Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou


Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little


Follow, and do me service.



Exeunt




ACT V

SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.



Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL



PROSPERO



Now does my project gather to a head:


My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time


Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?




ARIEL



On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,


You said our work should cease.




PROSPERO



I did say so,


When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,


How fares the king and's followers?




ARIEL



Confined together


In the same fashion as you gave in charge,


Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,


In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;


They cannot budge till your release. The king,


His brother and yours, abide all three distracted


And the remainder mourning over them,


Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly


Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'


His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops


From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em


That if you now beheld them, your affections


Would become tender.




PROSPERO



Dost thou think so, spirit?




ARIEL



Mine would, sir, were I human.




PROSPERO



And mine shall.


Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling


Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,


One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,


Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?


Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,


Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury


Do I take part: the rarer action is


In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,


The sole drift of my purpose doth extend


Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:


My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,


And they shall be themselves.




ARIEL



I'll fetch them, sir.



Exit




PROSPERO



Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,


And ye that on the sands with printless foot


Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him


When he comes back; you demi-puppets that


By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,


Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime


Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice


To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,


Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd


The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,


And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault


Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder


Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak


With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory


Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up


The pine and cedar: graves at my command


Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth


By my so potent art. But this rough magic


I here abjure, and, when I have required


Some heavenly music, which even now I do,


To work mine end upon their senses that


This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,


Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,


And deeper than did ever plummet sound


I'll drown my book.



Solemn music



Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a  frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;  SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all  enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,  and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:


A solemn air and the best comforter


To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,


Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,


For you are spell-stopp'd.


Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,


Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,


Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,


And as the morning steals upon the night,


Melting the darkness, so their rising senses


Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle


Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,


My true preserver, and a loyal sir


To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces


Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly


Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:


Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.


Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,


You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,


Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,


Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,


Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,


Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding


Begins to swell, and the approaching tide


Will shortly fill the reasonable shore


That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them


That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,


Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:


I will discase me, and myself present


As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;


Thou shalt ere long be free.



ARIEL sings and helps to attire him


Where the bee sucks. there suck I:


In a cowslip's bell I lie;


There I couch when owls do cry.


On the bat's back I do fly


After summer merrily.


Merrily, merrily shall I live now


Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.




PROSPERO



Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:


But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.


To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:


There shalt thou find the mariners asleep


Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain


Being awake, enforce them to this place,


And presently, I prithee.




ARIEL



I drink the air before me, and return


Or ere your pulse twice beat.



Exit




GONZALO



All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement


Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us


Out of this fearful country!




PROSPERO



Behold, sir king,


The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:


For more assurance that a living prince


Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;


And to thee and thy company I bid


A hearty welcome.




ALONSO



Whether thou best he or no,


Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,


As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse


Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,


The affliction of my mind amends, with which,


I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,


An if this be at all, a most strange story.


Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat


Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero


Be living and be here?




PROSPERO



First, noble friend,


Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot


Be measured or confined.




GONZALO



Whether this be


Or be not, I'll not swear.




PROSPERO



You do yet taste


Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you


Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!



Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO


But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,


I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you


And justify you traitors: at this time


I will tell no tales.




SEBASTIAN



[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.




PROSPERO



No.


For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother


Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive


Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require


My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,


Thou must restore.




ALONSO



If thou be'st Prospero,


Give us particulars of thy preservation;


How thou hast met us here, who three hours since


Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--


How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--


My dear son Ferdinand.




PROSPERO



I am woe for't, sir.




ALONSO



Irreparable is the loss, and patience


Says it is past her cure.




PROSPERO



I rather think


You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace


For the like loss I have her sovereign aid


And rest myself content.




ALONSO



You the like loss!




PROSPERO



As great to me as late; and, supportable


To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker


Than you may call to comfort you, for I


Have lost my daughter.




ALONSO



A daughter?


O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,


The king and queen there! that they were, I wish


Myself were mudded in that oozy bed


Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?




PROSPERO



In this last tempest. I perceive these lords


At this encounter do so much admire


That they devour their reason and scarce think


Their eyes do offices of truth, their words


Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have


Been justled from your senses, know for certain


That I am Prospero and that very duke


Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely


Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,


To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;


For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,


Not a relation for a breakfast nor


Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;


This cell's my court: here have I few attendants


And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.


My dukedom since you have given me again,


I will requite you with as good a thing;


At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye


As much as me my dukedom.



Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess




MIRANDA



Sweet lord, you play me false.




FERDINAND



No, my dear'st love,


I would not for the world.




MIRANDA



Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,


And I would call it, fair play.




ALONSO



If this prove


A vision of the Island, one dear son


Shall I twice lose.




SEBASTIAN



A most high miracle!




FERDINAND



Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;


I have cursed them without cause.



Kneels




ALONSO



Now all the blessings


Of a glad father compass thee about!


Arise, and say how thou camest here.




MIRANDA



O, wonder!


How many goodly creatures are there here!


How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,


That has such people in't!




PROSPERO



'Tis new to thee.




ALONSO



What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?


Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:


Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,


And brought us thus together?




FERDINAND



Sir, she is mortal;


But by immortal Providence she's mine:


I chose her when I could not ask my father


For his advice, nor thought I had one. She


Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,


Of whom so often I have heard renown,


But never saw before; of whom I have


Received a second life; and second father


This lady makes him to me.




ALONSO



I am hers:


But, O, how oddly will it sound that I


Must ask my child forgiveness!




PROSPERO



There, sir, stop:


Let us not burthen our remembrance with


A heaviness that's gone.




GONZALO



I have inly wept,


Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,


And on this couple drop a blessed crown!


For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way


Which brought us hither.




ALONSO



I say, Amen, Gonzalo!




GONZALO



Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue


Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice


Beyond a common joy, and set it down


With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage


Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,


And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife


Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom


In a poor isle and all of us ourselves


When no man was his own.




ALONSO



[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your hands:


Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart


That doth not wish you joy!




GONZALO



Be it so! Amen!



Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following


O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:


I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,


This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,


That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?


Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?




Boatswain



The best news is, that we have safely found


Our king and company; the next, our ship--


Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--


Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when


We first put out to sea.




ARIEL



[Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir, all this service


Have I done since I went.




PROSPERO



[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!




ALONSO



These are not natural events; they strengthen


From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?




Boatswain



If I did think, sir, I were well awake,


I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,


And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;


Where but even now with strange and several noises


Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,


And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,


We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;


Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld


Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master


Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,


Even in a dream, were we divided from them


And were brought moping hither.




ARIEL



[Aside to PROSPERO]          Was't well done?




PROSPERO



[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.




ALONSO



This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod


And there is in this business more than nature


Was ever conduct of: some oracle


Must rectify our knowledge.




PROSPERO



Sir, my liege,


Do not infest your mind with beating on


The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure


Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,


Which to you shall seem probable, of every


These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful


And think of each thing well.



Aside to ARIEL


Come hither, spirit:


Set Caliban and his companions free;


Untie the spell.



Exit ARIEL


How fares my gracious sir?


There are yet missing of your company


Some few odd lads that you remember not.



Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel




STEPHANO



Every man shift for all the rest, and


let no man take care for himself; for all is


but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!




TRINCULO



If these be true spies which I wear in my head,


here's a goodly sight.




CALIBAN



O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!


How fine my master is! I am afraid


He will chastise me.




SEBASTIAN



Ha, ha!


What things are these, my lord Antonio?


Will money buy 'em?




ANTONIO



Very like; one of them


Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.




PROSPERO



Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,


Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,


His mother was a witch, and one so strong


That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,


And deal in her command without her power.


These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--


For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them


To take my life. Two of these fellows you


Must know and own; this thing of darkness!


Acknowledge mine.




CALIBAN



I shall be pinch'd to death.




ALONSO



Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?




SEBASTIAN



He is drunk now: where had he wine?




ALONSO



And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they


Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?


How camest thou in this pickle?




TRINCULO



I have been in such a pickle since I


saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of


my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.




SEBASTIAN



Why, how now, Stephano!




STEPHANO



O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.




PROSPERO



You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?




STEPHANO



I should have been a sore one then.




ALONSO



This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.



Pointing to Caliban




PROSPERO



He is as disproportion'd in his manners


As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;


Take with you your companions; as you look


To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.




CALIBAN



Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter


And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass


Was I, to take this drunkard for a god


And worship this dull fool!




PROSPERO



Go to; away!




ALONSO



Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.




SEBASTIAN



Or stole it, rather.



Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO




PROSPERO



Sir, I invite your highness and your train


To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest


For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste


With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it


Go quick away; the story of my life


And the particular accidents gone by


Since I came to this isle: and in the morn


I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,


Where I have hope to see the nuptial


Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;


And thence retire me to my Milan, where


Every third thought shall be my grave.




ALONSO



I long


To hear the story of your life, which must


Take the ear strangely.




PROSPERO



I'll deliver all;


And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales


And sail so expeditious that shall catch


Your royal fleet far off.



Aside to ARIEL


My Ariel, chick,


That is thy charge: then to the elements


Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.



Exeunt


EPILOGUE


SPOKEN BY PROSPERO


Now my charms are all o'erthrown,


And what strength I have's mine own,


Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,


I must be here confined by you,


Or sent to Naples. Let me not,


Since I have my dukedom got


And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell


In this bare island by your spell;


But release me from my bands


With the help of your good hands:


Gentle breath of yours my sails


Must fill, or else my project fails,


Which was to please. Now I want


Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,


And my ending is despair,


Unless I be relieved by prayer,


Which pierces so that it assaults


Mercy itself and frees all faults.


As you from crimes would pardon'd be,


Let your indulgence set me free.



hat was of late an heretic,

As firm as faith.


PAGE

'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:

Be not as extreme in submission

As in offence.

But let our plot go forward: let our wives

Yet once again, to make us public sport,

Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,

Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.


FORD

There is no better way than that they spoke of.


PAGE

How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park

at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.


SIR HUGH EVANS

You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has

been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks

there should be terrors in him that he should not

come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have

no desires.


PAGE

So think I too.


MISTRESS FORD

Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,

And let us two devise to bring him thither.


MISTRESS PAGE

There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,

Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,

Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,

Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;

And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle

And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain

In a most hideous and dreadful manner:

You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know

The superstitious idle-headed eld

Received and did deliver to our age

This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.


PAGE

Why, yet there want not many that do fear

In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:

But what of this?


MISTRESS FORD

                  Marry, this is our device;

That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.


PAGE

Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:

And in this shape when you have brought him thither,

What shall be done with him? what is your plot?


MISTRESS PAGE

That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:

Nan Page my daughter and my little son

And three or four more of their growth we'll dress

Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,

With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,

And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,

As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,

Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once

With some diffused song: upon their sight,

We two in great amazedness will fly:

Then let them all encircle him about

And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,

And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,

In their so sacred paths he dares to tread

In shape profane.


MISTRESS FORD

                  And till he tell the truth,

Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound

And burn him with their tapers.


MISTRESS PAGE

The truth being known,

We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,

And mock him home to Windsor.


FORD

The children must

Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.


SIR HUGH EVANS

I will teach the children their behaviors; and I

will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the

knight with my taber.


FORD

That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.


MISTRESS PAGE

My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,

Finely attired in a robe of white.


PAGE

That silk will I go buy.


Aside

And in that time

Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away

And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.


FORD

Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook

He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.


MISTRESS PAGE

Fear not you that. Go get us properties

And tricking for our fairies.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery

honest knaveries.


Exeunt PAGE, FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS


MISTRESS PAGE

Go, Mistress Ford,

Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.


Exit MISTRESS FORD

I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,

And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.

That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;

And he my husband best of all affects.

The doctor is well money'd, and his friends

Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,

Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.


Exit

SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn.

Enter Host and SIMPLE

Host

What wouldst thou have, boor? what: thick-skin?

speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.


SIMPLE

Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff

from Master Slender.


Host

There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his

standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about

with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go

knock and call; hell speak like an Anthropophaginian

unto thee: knock, I say.


SIMPLE

There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his

chamber: I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come

down; I come to speak with her, indeed.


Host

Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed: I'll

call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from

thy lungs military: art thou there? it is thine

host, thine Ephesian, calls.


FALSTAFF

[Above]  How now, mine host!


Host

Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of

thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her

descend; my chambers are honourable: fie! privacy?

fie!


Enter FALSTAFF


FALSTAFF

There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with

me;  but she's gone.


SIMPLE

Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of

Brentford?


FALSTAFF

Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?


SIMPLE

My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing

her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether

one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the

chain or no.


FALSTAFF

I spake with the old woman about it.


SIMPLE

And what says she, I pray, sir?


FALSTAFF

Marry, she says that the very same man that

beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of

it.


SIMPLE

I would I could have spoken with the woman herself;

I had other things to have spoken with her too from

him.


FALSTAFF

What are they? let us know.


Host

Ay, come; quick.


SIMPLE

I may not conceal them, sir.


Host

Conceal them, or thou diest.


SIMPLE

Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne

Page; to know if it were my master's fortune to

have her or no.


FALSTAFF

'Tis, 'tis his fortune.


SIMPLE

What, sir?


FALSTAFF

To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.


SIMPLE

May I be bold to say so, sir?


FALSTAFF

Ay, sir; like who more bold.


SIMPLE

I thank your worship: I shall make my master glad

with these tidings.


Exit


Host

Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was

there a wise woman with thee?


FALSTAFF

Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught

me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;

and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for

my learning.


Enter BARDOLPH


BARDOLPH

Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!


Host

Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto.


BARDOLPH

Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came

beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of

them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,

like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.


Host

They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do not

say they be fled; Germans are honest men.


Enter SIR HUGH EVANS


SIR HUGH EVANS

Where is mine host?


Host

What is the matter, sir?


SIR HUGH EVANS

Have a care of your entertainments: there is a

friend of mine come to town tells me there is three

cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of

Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and

money. I tell you for good will, look you: you

are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and

'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.


Exit


Enter DOCTOR CAIUS


DOCTOR CAIUS

Vere is mine host de Jarteer?


Host

Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.


DOCTOR CAIUS

I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat

you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by

my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to

come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.


Exit


Host

Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight. I am

undone! Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!


Exeunt Host and BARDOLPH


FALSTAFF

I would all the world might be cozened; for I have

been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to

the ear of the court, how I have been transformed

and how my transformation hath been washed and

cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by

drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant

they would whip me with their fine wits till I were

as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered

since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my

wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.


Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY

Now, whence come you?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

From the two parties, forsooth.


FALSTAFF

The devil take one party and his dam the other! and

so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more

for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy

of man's disposition is able to bear.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;

speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,

is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a

white spot about her.


FALSTAFF

What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was

beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;

and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of

Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,

my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,

delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the

stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you

shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your

content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good

hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!

Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that

you are so crossed.


FALSTAFF

Come up into my chamber.


Exeunt

SCENE VI. Another room in the Garter Inn.

Enter FENTON and Host

Host

Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I

will give over all.


FENTON

Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,

And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee

A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.


Host

I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at the

least keep your counsel.


FENTON

From time to time I have acquainted you

With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;

Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,

So far forth as herself might be her chooser,

Even to my wish: I have a letter from her

Of such contents as you will wonder at;

The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,

That neither singly can be manifested,

Without the show of both; fat Falstaff

Hath a great scene: the image of the jest

I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.

To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,

Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;

The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,

While other jests are something rank on foot,

Her father hath commanded her to slip

Away with Slender and with him at Eton

Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,

Her mother, ever strong against that match

And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed

That he shall likewise shuffle her away,

While other sports are tasking of their minds,

And at the deanery, where a priest attends,

Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot

She seemingly obedient likewise hath

Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:

Her father means she shall be all in white,

And in that habit, when Slender sees his time

To take her by the hand and bid her go,

She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,

The better to denote her to the doctor,

For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,

That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,

With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;

And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,

To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,

The maid hath given consent to go with him.


Host

Which means she to deceive, father or mother?


FENTON

Both, my good host, to go along with me:

And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar

To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,

And, in the lawful name of marrying,

To give our hearts united ceremony.


Host

Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:

Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.


FENTON

So shall I evermore be bound to thee;

Besides, I'll make a present recompense.


Exeunt


ACT V
SCENE I. A room in the Garter Inn.

Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS QUICKLY

FALSTAFF

Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is

the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd

numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in

odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!


MISTRESS QUICKLY

I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to

get you a pair of horns.


FALSTAFF

Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.


Exit MISTRESS QUICKLY


Enter FORD

How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter

will be known to-night, or never. Be you in the

Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall

see wonders.


FORD

Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me

you had appointed?


FALSTAFF

I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor

old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a

poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,

hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,

Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell

you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a

woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear

not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know

also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along

with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I

plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew

not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow

me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave

Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I

will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.

Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.


Exeunt

SCENE II. Windsor Park.

Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER

PAGE

Come, come; we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we

see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender,

my daughter.


SLENDER

Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a

nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in

white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by

that we know one another.


SHALLOW

That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum'

or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well

enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.


PAGE

The night is dark; light and spirits will become it

well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil

but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns.

Let's away; follow me.


Exeunt

SCENE III. A street leading to the Park.

Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and DOCTOR CAIUS

MISTRESS PAGE

Master doctor, my daughter is in green: when you

see your time, take her by the band, away with her

to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before

into the Park: we two must go together.


DOCTOR CAIUS

I know vat I have to do. Adieu.


MISTRESS PAGE

Fare you well, sir.


Exit DOCTOR CAIUS

My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of

Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying

my daughter: but 'tis no matter; better a little

chiding than a great deal of heart-break.


MISTRESS FORD

Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the

Welsh devil Hugh?


MISTRESS PAGE

They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak,

with obscured lights; which, at the very instant of

Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once

display to the night.


MISTRESS FORD

That cannot choose but amaze him.


MISTRESS PAGE

If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be

amazed, he will every way be mocked.


MISTRESS FORD

We'll betray him finely.


MISTRESS PAGE

Against such lewdsters and their lechery

Those that betray them do no treachery.


MISTRESS FORD

The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!


Exeunt

SCENE IV. Windsor Park.

Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised, with others as Fairies

SIR HUGH EVANS

Trib, trib, fairies; come; and remember your parts:

be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit; and

when I give the watch-'ords, do as I pid you:

come, come; trib, trib.


Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the Park.

Enter FALSTAFF disguised as Herne

FALSTAFF

The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute

draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!

Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love

set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some

respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man

a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love

of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew

to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in

the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And

then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think

on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot

backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a

Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the

forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can

blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my

doe?


Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE


MISTRESS FORD

Sir John! art thou there, my deer? my male deer?


FALSTAFF

My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain

potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green

Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let

there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.


MISTRESS FORD

Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.


FALSTAFF

Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will

keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow

of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.

Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?

Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes

restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!


Noise within


MISTRESS PAGE

Alas, what noise?


MISTRESS FORD

Heaven forgive our sins


FALSTAFF

What should this be?


MISTRESS FORD


MISTRESS PAGE

Away, away!


They run off


FALSTAFF

I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the

oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would

never else cross me thus.


Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised as before; PISTOL,  as Hobgoblin; MISTRESS QUICKLY, ANNE PAGE, and others, as Fairies, with tapers


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,

You moonshine revellers and shades of night,

You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,

Attend your office and your quality.

Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.


PISTOL

Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.

Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:

Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,

There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:

Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.


FALSTAFF

They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:

I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.


Lies down upon his face


SIR HUGH EVANS

Where's Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid

That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,

Raise up the organs of her fantasy;

Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:

But those as sleep and think not on their sins,

Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

About, about;

Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:

Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:

That it may stand till the perpetual doom,

In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,

Worthy the owner, and the owner it.

The several chairs of order look you scour

With juice of balm and every precious flower:

Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,

With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!

And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,

Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:

The expressure that it bears, green let it be,

More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;

And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write

In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;

Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,

Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:

Fairies use flowers for their charactery.

Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,

Our dance of custom round about the oak

Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set

And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,

To guide our measure round about the tree.

But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.


FALSTAFF

Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he

transform me to a piece of cheese!


PISTOL

Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:

If he be chaste, the flame will back descend

And turn him to no pain; but if he start,

It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.


PISTOL

A trial, come.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Come, will this wood take fire?


They burn him with their tapers


FALSTAFF

Oh, Oh, Oh!


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!

About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;

And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.

SONG.

Fie on sinful fantasy!

Fie on lust and luxury!

Lust is but a bloody fire,

Kindled with unchaste desire,

Fed in heart, whose flames aspire

As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.

Pinch him, fairies, mutually;

Pinch him for his villany;

Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,

Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.


During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS  comes one way, and steals away a boy in green;  SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white;  and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.  A noise of hunting is heard within. All the  Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's head, and rises


Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, and MISTRESS FORD


PAGE

Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now

Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?


MISTRESS PAGE

I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher

Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?

See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes

Become the forest better than the town?


FORD

Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,

Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his

horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath

enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his

cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be

paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for

it, Master Brook.


MISTRESS FORD

Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.

I will never take you for my love again; but I will

always count you my deer.


FALSTAFF

I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.


FORD

Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.


FALSTAFF

And these are not fairies? I was three or four

times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet

the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my

powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a

received belief, in despite of the teeth of all

rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now

how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon

ill employment!


SIR HUGH EVANS

Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your

desires, and fairies will not pinse you.


FORD

Well said, fairy Hugh.


SIR HUGH EVANS

And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.


FORD

I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art

able to woo her in good English.


FALSTAFF

Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that

it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as

this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I

have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked

with a piece of toasted cheese.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.


FALSTAFF

'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the

taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This

is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking

through the realm.


MISTRESS PAGE

Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the

virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders

and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,

that ever the devil could have made you our delight?


FORD

What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?


MISTRESS PAGE

A puffed man?


PAGE

Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?


FORD

And one that is as slanderous as Satan?


PAGE

And as poor as Job?


FORD

And as wicked as his wife?


SIR HUGH EVANS

And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack

and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and

swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?


FALSTAFF

Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I

am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh

flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use

me as you will.


FORD

Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one

Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to

whom you should have been a pander: over and above

that you have suffered, I think to repay that money

will be a biting affliction.


PAGE

Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset

to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to

laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her

Master Slender hath married her daughter.


MISTRESS PAGE

[Aside]  Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my

daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.


Enter SLENDER


SLENDER

Whoa ho! ho, father Page!


PAGE

Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?


SLENDER

Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire

know on't; would I were hanged, la, else.


PAGE

Of what, son?


SLENDER

I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,

and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been

i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he

should have swinged me. If I did not think it had

been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis

a postmaster's boy.


PAGE

Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.


SLENDER

What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took

a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for

all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had

him.


PAGE

Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how

you should know my daughter by her garments?


SLENDER

I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she

cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet

it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.


MISTRESS PAGE

Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;

turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is

now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.


Enter DOCTOR CAIUS


DOCTOR CAIUS

Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'

married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;

it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.


MISTRESS PAGE

Why, did you take her in green?


DOCTOR CAIUS

Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.


Exit


FORD

This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?


PAGE

My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.


Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE

How now, Master Fenton!


ANNE PAGE

Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!


PAGE

Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?


MISTRESS PAGE

Why went you not with master doctor, maid?


FENTON

You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.

You would have married her most shamefully,

Where there was no proportion held in love.

The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,

Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.

The offence is holy that she hath committed;

And this deceit loses the name of craft,

Of disobedience, or unduteous title,

Since therein she doth evitate and shun

A thousand irreligious cursed hours,

Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.


FORD

Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:

In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;

Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.


FALSTAFF

I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to

strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.


PAGE

Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!

What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.


FALSTAFF

When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.


MISTRESS PAGE

Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,

Heaven give you many, many merry days!

Good husband, let us every one go home,

And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;

Sir John and all.


FORD

                  Let it be so. Sir John,

To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word

For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.


Exeunt

ance my father left me

Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.

I seek not to wax great by others' waning,

Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:

Sufficeth that I have maintains my state

And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.


CADE

Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a

stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave.

Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand

crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but

I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow

my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.


IDEN

Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,

I know thee not; why, then, should I betray thee?

Is't not enough to break into my garden,

And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,

Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,

But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?


CADE

Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was

broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I

have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou and

thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead

as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.


IDEN

Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,

That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,

Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.

Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,

See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:

Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;

Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,

Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;

My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;

And if mine arm be heaved in the air,

Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.

As for words, whose greatness answers words,

Let this my sword report what speech forbears.


CADE

By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I

heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out

the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou

sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou

mayst be turned to hobnails.


Here they fight. CADE falls

O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me:

let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me

but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them

all. Wither, garden; and be henceforth a

burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,

because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.


IDEN

Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?

Sword, I will hollow thee for this thy deed,

And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:

Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point;

But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,

To emblaze the honour that thy master got.


CADE

Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell

Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort

all the world to be cowards; for I, that never

feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.


Dies


IDEN

How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.

Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee;

And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,

So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.

Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels

Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,

And there cut off thy most ungracious head;

Which I will bear in triumph to the king,

Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.


Exit


ACT V
SCENE I. Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.

Enter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum and colours

YORK

From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,

And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:

Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,

To entertain great England's lawful king.

Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?

Let them obey that know not how to rule;

This hand was made to handle naught but gold.

I cannot give due action to my words,

Except a sword or sceptre balance it:

A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,

On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.


Enter BUCKINGHAM

Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?

The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.


BUCKINGHAM

York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.


YORK

Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.

Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?


BUCKINGHAM

A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,

To know the reason of these arms in peace;

Or why thou, being a subject as I am,

Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,

Should raise so great a power without his leave,

Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.


YORK

[Aside]  Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:

O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,

I am so angry at these abject terms;

And now, like Ajax Telamonius,

On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.

I am far better born than is the king,

More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:

But I must make fair weather yet a while,

Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--

Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,

That I have given no answer all this while;

My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.

The cause why I have brought this army hither

Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,

Seditious to his grace and to the state.


BUCKINGHAM

That is too much presumption on thy part:

But if thy arms be to no other end,

The king hath yielded unto thy demand:

The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.


YORK

Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?


BUCKINGHAM

Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.


YORK

Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.

Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;

Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,

You shall have pay and every thing you wish.

And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,

Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,

As pledges of my fealty and love;

I'll send them all as willing as I live:

Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,

Is his to use, so Somerset may die.


BUCKINGHAM

York, I commend this kind submission:

We twain will go into his highness' tent.


Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants


KING HENRY VI

Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,

That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?


YORK

In all submission and humility

York doth present himself unto your highness.


KING HENRY VI

Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?


YORK

To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,

And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,

Who since I heard to be discomfited.


Enter IDEN, with CADE'S head


IDEN

If one so rude and of so mean condition

May pass into the presence of a king,

Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,

The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.


KING HENRY VI

The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!

O, let me view his visage, being dead,

That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.

Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?


IDEN

I was, an't like your majesty.


KING HENRY VI

How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?


IDEN

Alexander Iden, that's my name;

A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.


BUCKINGHAM

So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss

He were created knight for his good service.


KING HENRY VI

Iden, kneel down.


He kneels

Rise up a knight.

We give thee for reward a thousand marks,

And will that thou henceforth attend on us.


IDEN

May Iden live to merit such a bounty.

And never live but true unto his liege!


Rises


Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET


KING HENRY VI

See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen:

Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.


QUEEN MARGARET

For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,

But boldly stand and front him to his face.


YORK

How now! is Somerset at liberty?

Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,

And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.

Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?

False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,

Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?

King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,

Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,

Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.

That head of thine doth not become a crown;

Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,

And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.

That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,

Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,

Is able with the change to kill and cure.

Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up

And with the same to act controlling laws.

Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more

O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.


SOMERSET

O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,

Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown;

Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.


YORK

Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,

If they can brook I bow a knee to man.

Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;


Exit Attendant

I know, ere they will have me go to ward,

They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.


QUEEN MARGARET

Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,

To say if that the bastard boys of York

Shall be the surety for their traitor father.


Exit BUCKINGHAM


YORK

O blood-besotted Neapolitan,

Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!

The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,

Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those

That for my surety will refuse the boys!


Enter EDWARD and RICHARD

See where they come: I'll warrant they'll

make it good.


Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD


QUEEN MARGARET

And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.


CLIFFORD

Health and all happiness to my lord the king!


Kneels


YORK

I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?

Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;

We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;

For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.


CLIFFORD

This is my king, York, I do not mistake;

But thou mistakest me much to think I do:

To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?


KING HENRY VI

Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour

Makes him oppose himself against his king.


CLIFFORD

He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,

And chop away that factious pate of his.


QUEEN MARGARET

He is arrested, but will not obey;

His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.


YORK

Will you not, sons?


EDWARD

Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.


RICHARD

And if words will not, then our weapons shall.


CLIFFORD

Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!


YORK

Look in a glass, and call thy image so:

I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.

Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,

That with the very shaking of their chains

They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:

Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.


Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY


CLIFFORD

Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.

And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,

If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.


RICHARD

Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur

Run back and bite, because he was withheld;

Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,

Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:

And such a piece of service will you do,

If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.


CLIFFORD

Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,

As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!


YORK

Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.


CLIFFORD

Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.


KING HENRY VI

Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?

Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,

Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!

What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,

And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?

O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?

If it be banish'd from the frosty head,

Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?

Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,

And shame thine honourable age with blood?

Why art thou old, and want'st experience?

Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?

For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me

That bows unto the grave with mickle age.


SALISBURY

My lord, I have consider'd with myself

The title of this most renowned duke;

And in my conscience do repute his grace

The rightful heir to England's royal seat.


KING HENRY VI

Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?


SALISBURY

I have.


KING HENRY VI

Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?


SALISBURY

It is great sin to swear unto a sin,

But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.

Who can be bound by any solemn vow

To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,

To force a spotless virgin's chastity,

To reave the orphan of his patrimony,

To wring the widow from her custom'd right,

And have no other reason for this wrong

But that he was bound by a solemn oath?


QUEEN MARGARET

A subtle traitor needs no sophister.


KING HENRY VI

Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.


YORK

Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,

I am resolved for death or dignity.


CLIFFORD

The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.


WARWICK

You were best to go to bed and dream again,

To keep thee from the tempest of the field.


CLIFFORD

I am resolved to bear a greater storm

Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;

And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,

Might I but know thee by thy household badge.


WARWICK

Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,

The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,

This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,

As on a mountain top the cedar shows

That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,

Even to affright thee with the view thereof.


CLIFFORD

And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear

And tread it under foot with all contempt,

Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.


YOUNG CLIFFORD

And so to arms, victorious father,

To quell the rebels and their complices.


RICHARD

Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,

For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.


YOUNG CLIFFORD

Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.


RICHARD

If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.


Exeunt severally

SCENE II. Saint Alban's.

Alarums to the battle. Enter WARWICK

WARWICK

Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls:

And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,

Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum

And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,

Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me:

Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,

Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.


Enter YORK

How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?


YORK

The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,

But match to match I have encounter'd him

And made a prey for carrion kites and crows

Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.


Enter CLIFFORD


WARWICK

Of one or both of us the time is come.


YORK

Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,

For I myself must hunt this deer to death.


WARWICK

Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.

As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,

It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.


Exit


CLIFFORD

What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?


YORK

With thy brave bearing should I be in love,

But that thou art so fast mine enemy.


CLIFFORD

Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,

But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.


YORK

So let it help me now against thy sword

As I in justice and true right express it.


CLIFFORD

My soul and body on the action both!


YORK

A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.


They fight, and CLIFFORD falls


CLIFFORD

La fin couronne les oeuvres.


Dies


YORK

Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still.

Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!


Exit


Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD


YOUNG CLIFFORD

Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;

Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds

Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,

Whom angry heavens do make their minister

Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part

Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.

He that is truly dedicate to war

Hath no self-love, nor he that loves himself

Hath not essentially but by circumstance

The name of valour.


Seeing his dead father

O, let the vile world end,

And the premised flames of the last day

Knit earth and heaven together!

Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,

Particularities and petty sounds

To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,

To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve

The silver livery of advised age,

And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus

To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight

My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,

It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;

No more will I their babes: tears virginal

Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,

And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims

Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.

Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:

Meet I an infant of the house of York,

Into as many gobbets will I cut it

As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:

In cruelty will I seek out my fame.

Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:

As did AEneas old Anchises bear,

So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;

But then AEneas bare a living load,

Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.


Exit, bearing off his father


Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight. SOMERSET is killed


RICHARD

So, lie thou there;

For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,

The Castle in Saint Alban's, Somerset

Hath made the wizard famous in his death.

Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:

Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.


Exit


Fight: excursions. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and others


QUEEN MARGARET

Away, my lord! you are slow; for shame, away!


KING HENRY VI

Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret, stay.


QUEEN MARGARET

What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:

Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,

To give the enemy way, and to secure us

By what we can, which can no more but fly.


Alarum afar off

If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom

Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,

As well we may, if not through your neglect,

We shall to London get, where you are loved

And where this breach now in our fortunes made

May readily be stopp'd.


Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD


YOUNG CLIFFORD

But that my heart's on future mischief set,

I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly:

But fly you must; uncurable discomfit

Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.

Away, for your relief! and we will live

To see their day and them our fortune give:

Away, my lord, away!


Exeunt

SCENE III. Fields near St. Alban's.

Alarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK, and Soldiers, with drum and colours

YORK

Of Salisbury, who can report of him,

That winter lion, who in rage forgets

Aged contusions and all brush of time,

And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,

Repairs him with occasion? This happy day

Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,

If Salisbury be lost.


RICHARD

My noble father,

Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,

Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,

Persuaded him from any further act:

But still, where danger was, still there I met him;

And like rich hangings in a homely house,

So was his will in his old feeble body.

But, noble as he is, look where he comes.


Enter SALISBURY


SALISBURY

Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day;

By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:

God knows how long it is I have to live;

And it hath pleased him that three times to-day

You have defended me from imminent death.

Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:

'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,

Being opposites of such repairing nature.


YORK

I know our safety is to follow them;

For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,

To call a present court of parliament.

Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.

What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?


WARWICK

After them! nay, before them, if we can.

Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day:

Saint Alban's battle won by famous York

Shall be eternized in all age to come.

Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all:

And more such days as these to us befall!


Exeunt

my soul to bliss, as I speak true;

So speaking as I think, I die, I die.


Dies


OTHELLO

I have another weapon in this chamber;

It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--

O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.


GRATIANO

[Within]  If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:

Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.


OTHELLO

Look in upon me then and speak with me,

Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.


Re-enter GRATIANO


GRATIANO

What is the matter?


OTHELLO

Behold, I have a weapon;

A better never did itself sustain

Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,

That, with this little arm and this good sword,

I have made my way through more impediments

Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!

Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.

Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;

Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,

And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.

Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;

Man but a rush against Othello's breast,

And he retires. Where should Othello go?

Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!

Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,

This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,

And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!

Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!

Whip me, ye devils,

From the possession of this heavenly sight!

Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!

Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!

O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!

Oh! Oh! Oh!


Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair, and Officers with IAGO, prisoner


LODOVICO

Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?


OTHELLO

That's he that was Othello: here I am.


LODOVICO

Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.


OTHELLO

I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.

If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.


Wounds IAGO


LODOVICO

Wrench his sword from him.


IAGO

I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.


OTHELLO

I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;

For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.


LODOVICO

O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,

Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,

What shall be said to thee?


OTHELLO

Why, any thing:

An honourable murderer, if you will;

For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.


LODOVICO

This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:

Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?


OTHELLO

Ay.


CASSIO

Dear general, I never gave you cause.


OTHELLO

I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.

Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil

Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?


IAGO

Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:

From this time forth I never will speak word.


LODOVICO

What, not to pray?


GRATIANO

                  Torments will ope your lips.


OTHELLO

Well, thou dost best.


LODOVICO

Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,

Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter

Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;

And here another: the one of them imports

The death of Cassio to be undertook

By Roderigo.


OTHELLO

O villain!


CASSIO

Most heathenish and most gross!


LODOVICO

Now here's another discontented paper,

Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,

Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;

But that belike Iago in the interim

Came in and satisfied him.


OTHELLO

O the pernicious caitiff!

How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief

That was my wife's?


CASSIO

I found it in my chamber:

And he himself confess'd but even now

That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose

Which wrought to his desire.


OTHELLO

O fool! fool! fool!


CASSIO

There is besides in Roderigo's letter,

How he upbraids Iago, that he made him

Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came

That I was cast: and even but now he spake,

After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,

Iago set him on.


LODOVICO

You must forsake this room, and go with us:

Your power and your command is taken off,

And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,

If there be any cunning cruelty

That can torment him much and hold him long,

It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,

Till that the nature of your fault be known

To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.


OTHELLO

Soft you; a word or two before you go.

I have done the state some service, and they know't.

No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,

When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,

Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,

Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak

Of one that loved not wisely but too well;

Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought

Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,

Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away

Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,

Albeit unused to the melting mood,

Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees

Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;

And say besides, that in Aleppo once,

Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk

Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,

I took by the throat the circumcised dog,

And smote him, thus.


Stabs himself


LODOVICO

O bloody period!


GRATIANO

                  All that's spoke is marr'd.


OTHELLO

I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;

Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.


Falls on the bed, and dies


CASSIO

This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;

For he was great of heart.


LODOVICO

[To IAGO]  O Spartan dog,

More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!

Look on the tragic loading of this bed;

This is thy work: the object poisons sight;

Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,

And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,

For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,

Remains the censure of this hellish villain;

The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!

Myself will straight aboard: and to the state

This heavy act with heavy heart relate.


Exeunt
