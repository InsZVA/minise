Sonnet CXII



Sonnet CXII

Your love and pity doth the impression fill
Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
For what care I who calls me well or ill,
So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
You are my all the world, and I must strive
To know my shames and praises from your tongue:
None else to me, nor I to none alive,
That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
In so profound abysm I throw all care
Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
You are so strongly in my purpose bred
That all the world besides methinks are dead.



y seditious countrymen and us,

It hath in solemn synods been decreed

Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,

To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,

If any born at Ephesus be seen

At any Syracusian marts and fairs;

Again: if any Syracusian born

Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,

His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,

Unless a thousand marks be levied,

To quit the penalty and to ransom him.

Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,

Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;

Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.


AEGEON

Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,

My woes end likewise with the evening sun.


DUKE SOLINUS

Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause

Why thou departed'st from thy native home

And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.


AEGEON

A heavier task could not have been imposed

Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:

Yet, that the world may witness that my end

Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,

I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.

In Syracusa was I born, and wed

Unto a woman, happy but for me,

And by me, had not our hap been bad.

With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased

By prosperous voyages I often made

To Epidamnum; till my factor's death

And the great care of goods at random left

Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:

From whom my absence was not six months old

Before herself, almost at fainting under

The pleasing punishment that women bear,

Had made provision for her following me

And soon and safe arrived where I was.

There had she not been long, but she became

A joyful mother of two goodly sons;

And, which was strange, the one so like the other,

As could not be distinguish'd but by names.

That very hour, and in the self-same inn,

A meaner woman was delivered

Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:

Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--

I bought and brought up to attend my sons.

My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,

Made daily motions for our home return:

Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,

We came aboard.

A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,

Before the always wind-obeying deep

Gave any tragic instance of our harm:

But longer did we not retain much hope;

For what obscured light the heavens did grant

Did but convey unto our fearful minds

A doubtful warrant of immediate death;

Which though myself would gladly have embraced,

Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,

Weeping before for what she saw must come,

And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,

That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,

Forced me to seek delays for them and me.

And this it was, for other means was none:

The sailors sought for safety by our boat,

And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:

My wife, more careful for the latter-born,

Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,

Such as seafaring men provide for storms;

To him one of the other twins was bound,

Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:

The children thus disposed, my wife and I,

Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,

Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;

And floating straight, obedient to the stream,

Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.

At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,

Dispersed those vapours that offended us;

And by the benefit of his wished light,

The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered

Two ships from far making amain to us,

Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:

But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!

Gather the sequel by that went before.


DUKE SOLINUS

Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;

For we may pity, though not pardon thee.


AEGEON

O, had the gods done so, I had not now

Worthily term'd them merciless to us!

For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,

We were encounterd by a mighty rock;

Which being violently borne upon,

Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;

So that, in this unjust divorce of us,

Fortune had left to both of us alike

What to delight in, what to sorrow for.

Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened

With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,

Was carried with more speed before the wind;

And in our sight they three were taken up

By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.

At length, another ship had seized on us;

And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,

Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;

And would have reft the fishers of their prey,

Had not their bark been very slow of sail;

And therefore homeward did they bend their course.

Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;

That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,

To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.


DUKE SOLINUS

And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,

Do me the favour to dilate at full

What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.


AEGEON

My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,

At eighteen years became inquisitive

After his brother: and importuned me

That his attendant--so his case was like,

Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--

Might bear him company in the quest of him:

Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,

I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.

Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,

Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,

And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;

Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought

Or that or any place that harbours men.

But here must end the story of my life;

And happy were I in my timely death,

Could all my travels warrant me they live.


DUKE SOLINUS

Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd

To bear the extremity of dire mishap!

Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,

Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,

Which princes, would they, may not disannul,

My soul would sue as advocate for thee.

But, though thou art adjudged to the death

And passed sentence may not be recall'd

But to our honour's great disparagement,

Yet I will favour thee in what I can.

Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day

To seek thy life by beneficial help:

Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;

Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,

And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.

Gaoler, take him to thy custody.


Gaoler

I will, my lord.


AEGEON

Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,

But to procrastinate his lifeless end.


Exeunt

SCENE II. The Mart.

Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant

First Merchant

Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,

Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.

This very day a Syracusian merchant

Is apprehended for arrival here;

And not being able to buy out his life

According to the statute of the town,

Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.

There is your money that I had to keep.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,

And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.

Within this hour it will be dinner-time:

Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,

Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,

And then return and sleep within mine inn,

For with long travel I am stiff and weary.

Get thee away.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Many a man would take you at your word,

And go indeed, having so good a mean.


Exit

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,

When I am dull with care and melancholy,

Lightens my humour with his merry jests.

What, will you walk with me about the town,

And then go to my inn and dine with me?


First Merchant

I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,

Of whom I hope to make much benefit;

I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,

Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart

And afterward consort you till bed-time:

My present business calls me from you now.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Farewell till then: I will go lose myself

And wander up and down to view the city.


First Merchant

Sir, I commend you to your own content.


Exit

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

He that commends me to mine own content

Commends me to the thing I cannot get.

I to the world am like a drop of water

That in the ocean seeks another drop,

Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,

Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:

So I, to find a mother and a brother,

In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.


Enter DROMIO of Ephesus

Here comes the almanac of my true date.

What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:

The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,

The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;

My mistress made it one upon my cheek:

She is so hot because the meat is cold;

The meat is cold because you come not home;

You come not home because you have no stomach;

You have no stomach having broke your fast;

But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray

Are penitent for your default to-day.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:

Where have you left the money that I gave you?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last

To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?

The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

I am not in a sportive humour now:

Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?

We being strangers here, how darest thou trust

So great a charge from thine own custody?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:

I from my mistress come to you in post;

If I return, I shall be post indeed,

For she will score your fault upon my pate.

Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,

And strike you home without a messenger.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;

Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.

Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,

And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

My charge was but to fetch you from the mart

Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:

My mistress and her sister stays for you.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,

Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours

That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:

Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

I have some marks of yours upon my pate,

Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,

But not a thousand marks between you both.

If I should pay your worship those again,

Perchance you will not bear them patiently.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;

She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,

And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,

Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!

Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.


Exit

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Upon my life, by some device or other

The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.

They say this town is full of cozenage,

As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,

Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,

Soul-killing witches that deform the body,

Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,

And many such-like liberties of sin:

If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.

I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:

I greatly fear my money is not safe.


Exit


ACT II
SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA

Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,

That in such haste I sent to seek his master!

Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.


LUCIANA

Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,

And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.

Good sister, let us dine and never fret:

A man is master of his liberty:

Time is their master, and, when they see time,

They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.


ADRIANA

Why should their liberty than ours be more?


LUCIANA

Because their business still lies out o' door.


ADRIANA

Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.


LUCIANA

O, know he is the bridle of your will.


ADRIANA

There's none but asses will be bridled so.


LUCIANA

Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.

There's nothing situate under heaven's eye

But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:

The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,

Are their males' subjects and at their controls:

Men, more divine, the masters of all these,

Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,

Indued with intellectual sense and souls,

Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,

Are masters to their females, and their lords:

Then let your will attend on their accords.


ADRIANA

This servitude makes you to keep unwed.


LUCIANA

Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.


ADRIANA

But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.


LUCIANA

Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.


ADRIANA

How if your husband start some other where?


LUCIANA

Till he come home again, I would forbear.


ADRIANA

Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;

They can be meek that have no other cause.

A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,

We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;

But were we burdened with like weight of pain,

As much or more would we ourselves complain:

So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,

With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,

But, if thou live to see like right bereft,

This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.


LUCIANA

Well, I will marry one day, but to try.

Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.


Enter DROMIO of Ephesus


ADRIANA

Say, is your tardy master now at hand?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears

can witness.


ADRIANA

Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:

Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.


LUCIANA

Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his

blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce

understand them.


ADRIANA

But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he

hath great care to please his wife.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.


ADRIANA

Horn-mad, thou villain!


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

I mean not cuckold-mad;

But, sure, he is stark mad.

When I desired him to come home to dinner,

He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:

''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;

'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:

'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.

'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'

'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:

'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!

I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'


LUCIANA

Quoth who?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Quoth my master:

'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'

So that my errand, due unto my tongue,

I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;

For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.


ADRIANA

Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Go back again, and be new beaten home?

For God's sake, send some other messenger.


ADRIANA

Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

And he will bless that cross with other beating:

Between you I shall have a holy head.


ADRIANA

Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Am I so round with you as you with me,

That like a football you do spurn me thus?

You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:

If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.


Exit


LUCIANA

Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!


ADRIANA

His company must do his minions grace,

Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.

Hath homely age the alluring beauty took

From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:

Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?

If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,

Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:

Do their gay vestments his affections bait?

That's not my fault: he's master of my state:

What ruins are in me that can be found,

By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground

Of my defeatures. My decayed fair

A sunny look of his would soon repair

But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale

And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.


LUCIANA

Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!


ADRIANA

Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.

I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,

Or else what lets it but he would be here?

Sister, you know he promised me a chain;

Would that alone, alone he would detain,

So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!

I see the jewel best enamelled

Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,

That others touch, and often touching will

Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,

By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.

Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,

I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.


LUCIANA

How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!


Exeunt

SCENE II. A public place.

Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up

Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave

Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out

By computation and mine host's report.

I could not speak with Dromio since at first

I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.


Enter DROMIO of Syracuse

How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?

As you love strokes, so jest with me again.

You know no Centaur? you received no gold?

Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?

My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,

That thus so madly thou didst answer me?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Even now, even here, not half an hour since.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I did not see you since you sent me hence,

Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,

And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;

For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I am glad to see you in this merry vein:

What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?

Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.


Beating him


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:

Upon what bargain do you give it me?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Because that I familiarly sometimes

Do use you for my fool and chat with you,

Your sauciness will jest upon my love

And make a common of my serious hours.

When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,

But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.

If you will jest with me, know my aspect,

And fashion your demeanor to my looks,

Or I will beat this method in your sconce.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I

had rather have it a head: an you use these blows

long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce

it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.

But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Dost thou not know?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Shall I tell you why?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath

a wherefore.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--

For urging it the second time to me.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,

When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme

nor reason?

Well, sir, I thank you.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Thank me, sir, for what?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for

something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

In good time, sir; what's that?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Basting.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Your reason?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another

dry basting.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a

time for all things.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

By what rule, sir?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald

pate of father Time himself.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Let's hear it.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

There's no time for a man to recover his hair that

grows bald by nature.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

May he not do it by fine and recovery?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the

lost hair of another man.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,

so plentiful an excrement?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;

and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth

it in a kind of jollity.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

For what reason?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

For two; and sound ones too.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Nay, not sound, I pray you.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Sure ones, then.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Certain ones then.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Name them.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

The one, to save the money that he spends in

trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not

drop in his porridge.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

You would all this time have proved there is no

time for all things.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair

lost by nature.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

But your reason was not substantial, why there is no

time to recover.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore

to the world's end will have bald followers.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:

But, soft! who wafts us yonder?


Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA


ADRIANA

Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:

Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;

I am not Adriana nor thy wife.

The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow

That never words were music to thine ear,

That never object pleasing in thine eye,

That never touch well welcome to thy hand,

That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,

Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.

How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,

That thou art thus estranged from thyself?

Thyself I call it, being strange to me,

That, undividable, incorporate,

Am better than thy dear self's better part.

Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!

For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall

A drop of water in the breaking gulf,

And take unmingled that same drop again,

Without addition or diminishing,

As take from me thyself and not me too.

How dearly would it touch me to the quick,

Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious

And that this body, consecrate to thee,

By ruffian lust should be contaminate!

Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me

And hurl the name of husband in my face

And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow

And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring

And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?

I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.

I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;

My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:

For if we too be one and thou play false,

I do digest the poison of thy flesh,

Being strumpeted by thy contagion.

Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;

I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:

In Ephesus I am but two hours old,

As strange unto your town as to your talk;

Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,

Want wit in all one word to understand.


LUCIANA

Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!

When were you wont to use my sister thus?

She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

By Dromio?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

By me?


ADRIANA

By thee; and this thou didst return from him,

That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,

Denied my house for his, me for his wife.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?

What is the course and drift of your compact?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I, sir? I never saw her till this time.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Villain, thou liest; for even her very words

Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I never spake with her in all my life.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

How can she thus then call us by our names,

Unless it be by inspiration.


ADRIANA

How ill agrees it with your gravity

To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,

Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!

Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,

But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.

Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:

Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,

Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,

Makes me with thy strength to communicate:

If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,

Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;

Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion

Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:

What, was I married to her in my dream?

Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?

What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?

Until I know this sure uncertainty,

I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.


LUCIANA

Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.

This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!

We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:

If we obey them not, this will ensue,

They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.


LUCIANA

Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?

Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I am transformed, master, am I not?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

I think thou art in mind, and so am I.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Thou hast thine own form.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

No, I am an ape.


LUCIANA

If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.

'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be

But I should know her as well as she knows me.


ADRIANA

Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,

To put the finger in the eye and weep,

Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.

Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.

Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day

And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.

Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,

Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.

Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?

Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?

Known unto these, and to myself disguised!

I'll say as they say and persever so,

And in this mist at all adventures go.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Master, shall I be porter at the gate?


ADRIANA

Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.


LUCIANA

Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.


Exeunt


ACT III
SCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR
ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;

My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:

Say that I linger'd with you at your shop

To see the making of her carcanet,

And that to-morrow you will bring it home.

But here's a villain that would face me down

He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,

And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,

And that I did deny my wife and house.

Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;

That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:

If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,

Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

I think thou art an ass.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Marry, so it doth appear

By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.

I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,

You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer

May answer my good will and your good welcome here.


BALTHAZAR

I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your

welcome dear.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,

A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.


BALTHAZAR

Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.


BALTHAZAR

Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:

But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;

Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.

But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

[Within]  Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,

idiot, patch!

Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.

Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st

for such store,

When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

What patch is made our porter? My master stays in

the street.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

[Within]  Let him walk from whence he came, lest he

catch cold on's feet.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Who talks within there? ho, open the door!


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

[Within]  Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell

me wherefore.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

[Within]  Nor to-day here you must not; come again

when you may.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

[Within]  The porter for this time, sir, and my name

is Dromio.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.

The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.

If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,

Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy

name for an ass.


LUCE

[Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those

at the gate?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Let my master in, Luce.


LUCE

[Within]  Faith, no; he comes too late;

And so tell your master.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

O Lord, I must laugh!

Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?


LUCE

[Within]  Have at you with another; that's--When?

can you tell?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

[Within]  If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast

answered him well.


ANTIPHOLUS

Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?

OF EPHESUS


LUCE

[Within]  I thought to have asked you.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

[Within]  And you said no.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Thou baggage, let me in.


LUCE

[Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Master, knock the door hard.


LUCE

[Within]  Let him knock till it ache.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.


LUCE

[Within]  What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?


ADRIANA

[Within]  Who is that at the door that keeps all

this noise?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

[Within]  By my troth, your town is troubled with

unruly boys.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Are you there, wife? you might have come before.


ADRIANA

[Within]  Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.


ANGELO

Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would

fain have either.


BALTHAZAR

In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.

Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:

It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

[Within]  Break any breaking here, and I'll break your

knave's pate.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,

Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

[Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon

thee, hind!


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,

let me in.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

[Within]  Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?

For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;

If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.


BALTHAZAR

Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!

Herein you war against your reputation

And draw within the compass of suspect

The unviolated honour of your wife.

Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,

Her sober virtue, years and modesty,

Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:

And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse

Why at this time the doors are made against you.

Be ruled by me: depart in patience,

And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,

And about evening come yourself alone

To know the reason of this strange restraint.

If by strong hand you offer to break in

Now in the stirring passage of the day,

A vulgar comment will be made of it,

And that supposed by the common rout

Against your yet ungalled estimation

That may with foul intrusion enter in

And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;

For slander lives upon succession,

For ever housed where it gets possession.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,

And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.

I know a wench of excellent discourse,

Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:

There will we dine. This woman that I mean,

My wife--but, I protest, without desert--

Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:

To her will we to dinner.


To Angelo

Get you home

And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:

Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;

For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--

Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--

Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.

Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,

I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.


ANGELO

I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.


Exeunt

SCENE II. The same.

Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse

LUCIANA

And may it be that you have quite forgot

A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.

Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?

Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?

If you did wed my sister for her wealth,

Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:

Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;

Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:

Let not my sister read it in your eye;

Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;

Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;

Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;

Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;

Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;

Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?

What simple thief brags of his own attaint?

'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed

And let her read it in thy looks at board:

Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;

Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.

Alas, poor women! make us but believe,

Being compact of credit, that you love us;

Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;

We in your motion turn and you may move us.

Then, gentle brother, get you in again;

Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:

'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,

When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,

Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--

Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not

Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.

Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;

Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,

Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,

The folded meaning of your words' deceit.

Against my soul's pure truth why labour you

To make it wander in an unknown field?

Are you a god? would you create me new?

Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.

But if that I am I, then well I know

Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,

Nor to her bed no homage do I owe

Far more, far more to you do I decline.

O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,

To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:

Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:

Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,

And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,

And in that glorious supposition think

He gains by death that hath such means to die:

Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!


LUCIANA

What, are you mad, that you do reason so?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.


LUCIANA

It is a fault that springeth from your eye.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.


LUCIANA

Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.


LUCIANA

Why call you me love? call my sister so.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Thy sister's sister.


LUCIANA

That's my sister.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

No;

It is thyself, mine own self's better part,

Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,

My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,

My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.


LUCIANA

All this my sister is, or else should be.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.

Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:

Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.

Give me thy hand.


LUCIANA

                  O, soft, air! hold you still:

I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.


Exit


Enter DROMIO of Syracuse

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?

am I myself?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.


ANTIPHOLUS

What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one

that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

What claim lays she to thee?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your

horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I

being a beast, she would have me; but that she,

being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

What is she?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may

not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have

but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a

wondrous fat marriage.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

How dost thou mean a fat marriage?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;

and I know not what use to put her to but to make a

lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I

warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a

Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,

she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

What complexion is she of?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so

clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over

shoes in the grime of it.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

That's a fault that water will mend.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

What's her name?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's

an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from

hip to hip.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Then she bears some breadth?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:

she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out

countries in her.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

In what part of her body stands Ireland?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Where Scotland?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Where France?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war

against her heir.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Where England?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no

whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,

by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Where Spain?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Where America, the Indies?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with

rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich

aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole

armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this

drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me

Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what

privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my

shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my

left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:

And, I think, if my breast had not been made of

faith and my heart of steel,

She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made

me turn i' the wheel.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Go hie thee presently, post to the road:

An if the wind blow any way from shore,

I will not harbour in this town to-night:

If any bark put forth, come to the mart,

Where I will walk till thou return to me.

If every one knows us and we know none,

'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

As from a bear a man would run for life,

So fly I from her that would be my wife.


Exit

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

There's none but witches do inhabit here;

And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.

She that doth call me husband, even my soul

Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,

Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,

Of such enchanting presence and discourse,

Hath almost made me traitor to myself:

But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,

I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.


Enter ANGELO with the chain


ANGELO

Master Antipholus,--

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Ay, that's my name.


ANGELO

I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.

I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:

The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

What is your will that I shall do with this?


ANGELO

What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.


ANGELO

Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.

Go home with it and please your wife withal;

And soon at supper-time I'll visit you

And then receive my money for the chain.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

I pray you, sir, receive the money now,

For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.


ANGELO

You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.


Exit

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

What I should think of this, I cannot tell:

But this I think, there's no man is so vain

That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.

I see a man here needs not live by shifts,

When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.

I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay

If any ship put out, then straight away.


Exit


ACT IV
SCENE I. A public place.

Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer

Second Merchant

You know since Pentecost the sum is due,

And since I have not much importuned you;

Nor now I had not, but that I am bound

To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:

Therefore make present satisfaction,

Or I'll attach you by this officer.


ANGELO

Even just the sum that I do owe to you

Is growing to me by Antipholus,

And in the instant that I met with you

He had of me a chain: at five o'clock

I shall receive the money for the same.

Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,

I will discharge my bond and thank you too.


Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's


Officer

That labour may you save: see where he comes.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou

And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow

Among my wife and her confederates,

For locking me out of my doors by day.

But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;

Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.


Exit

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

A man is well holp up that trusts to you:

I promised your presence and the chain;

But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.

Belike you thought our love would last too long,

If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.


ANGELO

Saving your merry humour, here's the note

How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,

The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.

Which doth amount to three odd ducats more

Than I stand debted to this gentleman:

I pray you, see him presently discharged,

For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

I am not furnish'd with the present money;

Besides, I have some business in the town.

Good signior, take the stranger to my house

And with you take the chain and bid my wife

Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:

Perchance I will be there as soon as you.


ANGELO

Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.


ANGELO

Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;

Or else you may return without your money.


ANGELO

Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:

Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,

And I, to blame, have held him here too long.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse

Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.

I should have chid you for not bringing it,

But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.


Second Merchant

The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.


ANGELO

You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.


ANGELO

Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.

Either send the chain or send me by some token.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,

where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.


Second Merchant

My business cannot brook this dalliance.

Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:

If not, I'll leave him to the officer.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

I answer you! what should I answer you?


ANGELO

The money that you owe me for the chain.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

I owe you none till I receive the chain.


ANGELO

You know I gave it you half an hour since.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.


ANGELO

You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:

Consider how it stands upon my credit.


Second Merchant

Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.


Officer

I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.


ANGELO

This touches me in reputation.

Either consent to pay this sum for me

Or I attach you by this officer.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Consent to pay thee that I never had!

Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.


ANGELO

Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,

I would not spare my brother in this case,

If he should scorn me so apparently.


Officer

I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

I do obey thee till I give thee bail.

But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear

As all the metal in your shop will answer.


ANGELO

Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,

To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.


Enter DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum

That stays but till her owner comes aboard,

And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,

I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought

The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.

The ship is in her trim; the merry wind

Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all

But for their owner, master, and yourself.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,

What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;

And told thee to what purpose and what end.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

You sent me for a rope's end as soon:

You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

I will debate this matter at more leisure

And teach your ears to list me with more heed.

To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:

Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk

That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,

There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:

Tell her I am arrested in the street

And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!

On, officer, to prison till it come.


Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and Antipholus of Ephesus


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

To Adriana! that is where we dined,

Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:

She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.

Thither I must, although against my will,

For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.


Exit

SCENE II. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA

Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?

Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye

That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?

Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?

What observation madest thou in this case

Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?


LUCIANA

First he denied you had in him no right.


ADRIANA

He meant he did me none; the more my spite.


LUCIANA

Then swore he that he was a stranger here.


ADRIANA

And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.


LUCIANA

Then pleaded I for you.


ADRIANA

And what said he?


LUCIANA

That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.


ADRIANA

With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?


LUCIANA

With words that in an honest suit might move.

First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.


ADRIANA

Didst speak him fair?


LUCIANA

Have patience, I beseech.


ADRIANA

I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;

My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.

He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,

Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;

Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;

Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.


LUCIANA

Who would be jealous then of such a one?

No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.


ADRIANA

Ah, but I think him better than I say,

And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.

Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:

My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.


Enter DROMIO of Syracuse


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.


LUCIANA

How hast thou lost thy breath?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

By running fast.


ADRIANA

Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.

A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;

One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;

A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;

A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;

A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that

countermands

The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;

A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;

One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.


ADRIANA

Why, man, what is the matter?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.


ADRIANA

What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;

But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.

Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?


ADRIANA

Go fetch it, sister.


Exit Luciana

This I wonder at,

That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.

Tell me, was he arrested on a band?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;

A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?


ADRIANA

What, the chain?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:

It was two ere I left him, and now the clock

strikes one.


ADRIANA

The hours come back! that did I never hear.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for

very fear.


ADRIANA

As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's

worth, to season.

Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say

That Time comes stealing on by night and day?

If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,

Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?


Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse


ADRIANA

Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;

And bring thy master home immediately.

Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--

Conceit, my comfort and my injury.


Exeunt

SCENE III. A public place.

Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

There's not a man I meet but doth salute me

As if I were their well-acquainted friend;

And every one doth call me by my name.

Some tender money to me; some invite me;

Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;

Some offer me commodities to buy:

Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop

And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,

And therewithal took measure of my body.

Sure, these are but imaginary wiles

And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.


Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have

you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam

that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's

skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came

behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you

forsake your liberty.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

I understand thee not.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a

bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,

that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob

and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed

men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up

his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a

morris-pike.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

What, thou meanest an officer?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings

any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that

thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God

give you good rest!'

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the

bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were

you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy

Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to

deliver you.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

The fellow is distract, and so am I;

And here we wander in illusions:

Some blessed power deliver us from hence!


Enter a Courtezan


Courtezan

Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.

I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:

Is that the chain you promised me to-day?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Master, is this Mistress Satan?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

It is the devil.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here

she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof

comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as

much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is

written, they appear to men like angels of light:

light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;

ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.


Courtezan

Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.

Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a

long spoon.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Why, Dromio?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with

the devil.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?

Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:

I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.


Courtezan

Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,

Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,

And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,

A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,

A nut, a cherry-stone;

But she, more covetous, would have a chain.

Master, be wise: an if you give it her,

The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.


Courtezan

I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:

I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.


Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse


Courtezan

Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,

Else would he never so demean himself.

A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,

And for the same he promised me a chain:

Both one and other he denies me now.

The reason that I gather he is mad,

Besides this present instance of his rage,

Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,

Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.

Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,

On purpose shut the doors against his way.

My way is now to hie home to his house,

And tell his wife that, being lunatic,

He rush'd into my house and took perforce

My ring away. This course I fittest choose;

For forty ducats is too much to lose.


Exit

SCENE IV. A street.

Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer
ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Fear me not, man; I will not break away:

I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,

To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.

My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,

And will not lightly trust the messenger

That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,

I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.


Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end

Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.

How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

But where's the money?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.


Beating him


Officer

Good sir, be patient.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.


Officer

Good, now, hold thy tongue.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Thou whoreson, senseless villain!


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel

your blows.


ANTIPHOLUS

Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an

ass.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long

ears. I have served him from the hour of my

nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his

hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he

heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me

with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;

raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with

it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when

I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a

beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath

lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.


Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or

rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the

rope's-end.'

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Wilt thou still talk?


Beating him


Courtezan

How say you now? is not your husband mad?


ADRIANA

His incivility confirms no less.

Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;

Establish him in his true sense again,

And I will please you what you will demand.


LUCIANA

Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!


Courtezan

Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!


PINCH

Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.


Striking him


PINCH

I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,

To yield possession to my holy prayers

And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:

I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.


ADRIANA

O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

You minion, you, are these your customers?

Did this companion with the saffron face

Revel and feast it at my house to-day,

Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut

And I denied to enter in my house?


ADRIANA

O husband, God doth know you dined at home;

Where would you had remain'd until this time,

Free from these slanders and this open shame!

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

And did not she herself revile me there?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

And did not I in rage depart from thence?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

In verity you did; my bones bear witness,

That since have felt the vigour of his rage.


ADRIANA

Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?


PINCH

It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,

And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.


ADRIANA

Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,

By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;

But surely master, not a rag of money.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?


ADRIANA

He came to me and I deliver'd it.


LUCIANA

And I am witness with her that she did.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

God and the rope-maker bear me witness

That I was sent for nothing but a rope!


PINCH

Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;

I know it by their pale and deadly looks:

They must be bound and laid in some dark room.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?

And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?


ADRIANA

I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

And, gentle master, I received no gold;

But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.


ADRIANA

Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;

And art confederate with a damned pack

To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:

But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes

That would behold in me this shameful sport.


Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives


ADRIANA

O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.


PINCH

More company! The fiend is strong within him.


LUCIANA

Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,

I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them

To make a rescue?


Officer

                  Masters, let him go

He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.


PINCH

Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.


They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus


ADRIANA

What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?

Hast thou delight to see a wretched man

Do outrage and displeasure to himself?


Officer

He is my prisoner: if I let him go,

The debt he owes will be required of me.


ADRIANA

I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:

Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,

And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.

Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd

Home to my house. O most unhappy day!

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

O most unhappy strumpet!


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Master, I am here entered in bond for you.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:

cry 'The devil!'


LUCIANA

God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!


ADRIANA

Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.


Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtezan

Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?


Officer

One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?


ADRIANA

I know the man. What is the sum he owes?


Officer

Two hundred ducats.


ADRIANA

Say, how grows it due?


Officer

Due for a chain your husband had of him.


ADRIANA

He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.


Courtezan

When as your husband all in rage to-day

Came to my house and took away my ring--

The ring I saw upon his finger now--

Straight after did I meet him with a chain.


ADRIANA

It may be so, but I did never see it.

Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:

I long to know the truth hereof at large.


Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn, and DROMIO of Syracuse


LUCIANA

God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.


ADRIANA

And come with naked swords.

Let's call more help to have them bound again.


Officer

Away! they'll kill us.


Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

I see these witches are afraid of swords.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

She that would be your wife now ran from you.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:

I long that we were safe and sound aboard.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us

no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:

methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for

the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of

me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and

turn witch.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

I will not stay to-night for all the town;

Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.


Exeunt


ACT V
SCENE I. A street before a Priory.

Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO

ANGELO

I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;

But, I protest, he had the chain of me,

Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.


Second Merchant

How is the man esteemed here in the city?


ANGELO

Of very reverend reputation, sir,

Of credit infinite, highly beloved,

Second to none that lives here in the city:

His word might bear my wealth at any time.


Second Merchant

Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.


Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse


ANGELO

'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck

Which he forswore most monstrously to have.

Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.

Signior Antipholus, I wonder much

That you would put me to this shame and trouble;

And, not without some scandal to yourself,

With circumstance and oaths so to deny

This chain which now you wear so openly:

Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,

You have done wrong to this my honest friend,

Who, but for staying on our controversy,

Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:

This chain you had of me; can you deny it?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

I think I had; I never did deny it.


Second Merchant

Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?


Second Merchant

These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.

Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest

To walk where any honest man resort.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:

I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty

Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.


Second Merchant

I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.


They draw


Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and others


ADRIANA

Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.

Some get within him, take his sword away:

Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!

This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!


Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the Priory


Enter the Lady Abbess, AEMILIA


AEMELIA

Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?


ADRIANA

To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.

Let us come in, that we may bind him fast

And bear him home for his recovery.


ANGELO

I knew he was not in his perfect wits.


Second Merchant

I am sorry now that I did draw on him.


AEMELIA

How long hath this possession held the man?


ADRIANA

This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,

And much different from the man he was;

But till this afternoon his passion

Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.


AEMELIA

Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?

Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye

Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?

A sin prevailing much in youthful men,

Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.

Which of these sorrows is he subject to?


ADRIANA

To none of these, except it be the last;

Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.


AEMELIA

You should for that have reprehended him.


ADRIANA

Why, so I did.


AEMELIA

                  Ay, but not rough enough.


ADRIANA

As roughly as my modesty would let me.


AEMELIA

Haply, in private.


ADRIANA

And in assemblies too.


AEMELIA

Ay, but not enough.


ADRIANA

It was the copy of our conference:

In bed he slept not for my urging it;

At board he fed not for my urging it;

Alone, it was the subject of my theme;

In company I often glanced it;

Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.


AEMELIA

And thereof came it that the man was mad.

The venom clamours of a jealous woman

Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.

It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,

And therefore comes it that his head is light.

Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:

Unquiet meals make ill digestions;

Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;

And what's a fever but a fit of madness?

Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:

Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue

But moody and dull melancholy,

Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,

And at her heels a huge infectious troop

Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?

In food, in sport and life-preserving rest

To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:

The consequence is then thy jealous fits

Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.


LUCIANA

She never reprehended him but mildly,

When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.

Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?


ADRIANA

She did betray me to my own reproof.

Good people enter and lay hold on him.


AEMELIA

No, not a creature enters in my house.


ADRIANA

Then let your servants bring my husband forth.


AEMELIA

Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,

And it shall privilege him from your hands

Till I have brought him to his wits again,

Or lose my labour in assaying it.


ADRIANA

I will attend my husband, be his nurse,

Diet his sickness, for it is my office,

And will have no attorney but myself;

And therefore let me have him home with me.


AEMELIA

Be patient; for I will not let him stir

Till I have used the approved means I have,

With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,

To make of him a formal man again:

It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,

A charitable duty of my order.

Therefore depart and leave him here with me.


ADRIANA

I will not hence and leave my husband here:

And ill it doth beseem your holiness

To separate the husband and the wife.


AEMELIA

Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.


Exit


LUCIANA

Complain unto the duke of this indignity.


ADRIANA

Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet

And never rise until my tears and prayers

Have won his grace to come in person hither

And take perforce my husband from the abbess.


Second Merchant

By this, I think, the dial points at five:

Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person

Comes this way to the melancholy vale,

The place of death and sorry execution,

Behind the ditches of the abbey here.


ANGELO

Upon what cause?


Second Merchant

To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,

Who put unluckily into this bay

Against the laws and statutes of this town,

Beheaded publicly for his offence.


ANGELO

See where they come: we will behold his death.


LUCIANA

Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.


Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the Headsman and other Officers


DUKE SOLINUS

Yet once again proclaim it publicly,

If any friend will pay the sum for him,

He shall not die; so much we tender him.


ADRIANA

Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!


DUKE SOLINUS

She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:

It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.


ADRIANA

May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,

Whom I made lord of me and all I had,

At your important letters,--this ill day

A most outrageous fit of madness took him;

That desperately he hurried through the street,

With him his bondman, all as mad as he--

Doing displeasure to the citizens

By rushing in their houses, bearing thence

Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.

Once did I get him bound and sent him home,

Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,

That here and there his fury had committed.

Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,

He broke from those that had the guard of him;

And with his mad attendant and himself,

Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,

Met us again and madly bent on us,

Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,

We came again to bind them. Then they fled

Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:

And here the abbess shuts the gates on us

And will not suffer us to fetch him out,

Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.

Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command

Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.


DUKE SOLINUS

Long since thy husband served me in my wars,

And I to thee engaged a prince's word,

When thou didst make him master of thy bed,

To do him all the grace and good I could.

Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate

And bid the lady abbess come to me.

I will determine this before I stir.


Enter a Servant


Servant

O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!

My master and his man are both broke loose,

Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor

Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;

And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him

Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:

My master preaches patience to him and the while

His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,

And sure, unless you send some present help,

Between them they will kill the conjurer.


ADRIANA

Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,

And that is false thou dost report to us.


Servant

Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;

I have not breathed almost since I did see it.

He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,

To scorch your face and to disfigure you.


Cry within

Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!


DUKE SOLINUS

Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!


ADRIANA

Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,

That he is borne about invisible:

Even now we housed him in the abbey here;

And now he's there, past thought of human reason.


Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!

Even for the service that long since I did thee,

When I bestrid thee in the wars and took

Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood

That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.


AEGEON

Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,

I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!

She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,

That hath abused and dishonour'd me

Even in the strength and height of injury!

Beyond imagination is the wrong

That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.


DUKE SOLINUS

Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,

While she with harlots feasted in my house.


DUKE SOLINUS

A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?


ADRIANA

No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister

To-day did dine together. So befall my soul

As this is false he burdens me withal!


LUCIANA

Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,

But she tells to your highness simple truth!


ANGELO

O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:

In this the madman justly chargeth them.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

My liege, I am advised what I say,

Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,

Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,

Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.

This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:

That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,

Could witness it, for he was with me then;

Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,

Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,

Where Balthazar and I did dine together.

Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,

I went to seek him: in the street I met him

And in his company that gentleman.

There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down

That I this day of him received the chain,

Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which

He did arrest me with an officer.

I did obey, and sent my peasant home

For certain ducats: he with none return'd

Then fairly I bespoke the officer

To go in person with me to my house.

By the way we met

My wife, her sister, and a rabble more

Of vile confederates. Along with them

They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,

A mere anatomy, a mountebank,

A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,

A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,

A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,

Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,

And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,

And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,

Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together

They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence

And in a dark and dankish vault at home

There left me and my man, both bound together;

Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,

I gain'd my freedom, and immediately

Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech

To give me ample satisfaction

For these deep shames and great indignities.


ANGELO

My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,

That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.


DUKE SOLINUS

But had he such a chain of thee or no?


ANGELO

He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,

These people saw the chain about his neck.


Second Merchant

Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine

Heard you confess you had the chain of him

After you first forswore it on the mart:

And thereupon I drew my sword on you;

And then you fled into this abbey here,

From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

I never came within these abbey-walls,

Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:

I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!

And this is false you burden me withal.


DUKE SOLINUS

Why, what an intricate impeach is this!

I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.

If here you housed him, here he would have been;

If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:

You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here

Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.


Courtezan

He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.


DUKE SOLINUS

Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?


Courtezan

As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.


DUKE SOLINUS

Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.

I think you are all mated or stark mad.


Exit one to Abbess


AEGEON

Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:

Haply I see a friend will save my life

And pay the sum that may deliver me.


DUKE SOLINUS

Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.


AEGEON

Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?

And is not that your bondman, Dromio?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Within this hour I was his bondman sir,

But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:

Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.


AEGEON

I am sure you both of you remember me.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;

For lately we were bound, as you are now

You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?


AEGEON

Why look you strange on me? you know me well.


ANTIPHOLUS

I never saw you in my life till now.


AEGEON

O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,

And careful hours with time's deformed hand

Have written strange defeatures in my face:

But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Neither.


AEGEON

Dromio, nor thou?


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

                  No, trust me, sir, nor I.


AEGEON

I am sure thou dost.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a

man denies, you are now bound to believe him.


AEGEON

Not know my voice! O time's extremity,

Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue

In seven short years, that here my only son

Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?

Though now this grained face of mine be hid

In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,

And all the conduits of my blood froze up,

Yet hath my night of life some memory,

My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,

My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:

All these old witnesses--I cannot err--

Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

I never saw my father in my life.


AEGEON

But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,

Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,

Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

The duke and all that know me in the city

Can witness with me that it is not so

I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.


DUKE SOLINUS

I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years

Have I been patron to Antipholus,

During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:

I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.


Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse


AEMELIA

Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.


All gather to see them


ADRIANA

I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.


DUKE SOLINUS

One of these men is Genius to the other;

And so of these. Which is the natural man,

And which the spirit? who deciphers them?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

O, my old master! who hath bound him here?


AEMELIA

Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds

And gain a husband by his liberty.

Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man

That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia

That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:

O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,

And speak unto the same AEmilia!


AEGEON

If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:

If thou art she, tell me where is that son

That floated with thee on the fatal raft?


AEMELIA

By men of Epidamnum he and I

And the twin Dromio all were taken up;

But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth

By force took Dromio and my son from them

And me they left with those of Epidamnum.

What then became of them I cannot tell

I to this fortune that you see me in.


DUKE SOLINUS

Why, here begins his morning story right;

These two Antipholuses, these two so like,

And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--

Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--

These are the parents to these children,

Which accidentally are met together.

Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.


DUKE SOLINUS

Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

And I with him.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,

Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.


ADRIANA

Which of you two did dine with me to-day?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

I, gentle mistress.


ADRIANA

And are not you my husband?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

No; I say nay to that.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

And so do I; yet did she call me so:

And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,

Did call me brother.


To Luciana

What I told you then,

I hope I shall have leisure to make good;

If this be not a dream I see and hear.


ANGELO

That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

I think it be, sir; I deny it not.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.


ANGELO

I think I did, sir; I deny it not.


ADRIANA

I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,

By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

No, none by me.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

This purse of ducats I received from you,

And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.

I see we still did meet each other's man,

And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,

And thereupon these errors are arose.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

These ducats pawn I for my father here.


DUKE SOLINUS

It shall not need; thy father hath his life.


Courtezan

Sir, I must have that diamond from you.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.


AEMELIA

Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains

To go with us into the abbey here

And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:

And all that are assembled in this place,

That by this sympathized one day's error

Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,

And we shall make full satisfaction.

Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail

Of you, my sons; and till this present hour

My heavy burden ne'er delivered.

The duke, my husband and my children both,

And you the calendars of their nativity,

Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;

After so long grief, such festivity!


DUKE SOLINUS

With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.


Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?

ANTIPHOLUS


OF EPHESUS

Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.

ANTIPHOLUS


OF SYRACUSE

He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:

Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:

Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.


Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

There is a fat friend at your master's house,

That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:

She now shall be my sister, not my wife.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:

I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.

Will you walk in to see their gossiping?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Not I, sir; you are my elder.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

That's a question: how shall we try it?


DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.


DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Nay, then, thus:

We came into the world like brother and brother;

And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.


Exeunt


HASTINGS

We have sent forth already.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

'Tis well done.

My friends and brethren in these great affairs,

I must acquaint you that I have received

New-dated letters from Northumberland;

Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:

Here doth he wish his person, with such powers

As might hold sortance with his quality,

The which he could not levy; whereupon

He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,

To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers

That your attempts may overlive the hazard

And fearful melting of their opposite.


MOWBRAY

Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground

And dash themselves to pieces.


Enter a Messenger


HASTINGS

Now, what news?


Messenger

West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,

In goodly form comes on the enemy;

And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number

Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.


MOWBRAY

The just proportion that we gave them out

Let us sway on and face them in the field.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

What well-appointed leader fronts us here?


Enter WESTMORELAND


MOWBRAY

I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.


WESTMORELAND

Health and fair greeting from our general,

The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:

What doth concern your coming?


WESTMORELAND

Then, my lord,

Unto your grace do I in chief address

The substance of my speech. If that rebellion

Came like itself, in base and abject routs,

Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,

And countenanced by boys and beggary,

I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,

In his true, native and most proper shape,

You, reverend father, and these noble lords

Had not been here, to dress the ugly form

Of base and bloody insurrection

With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,

Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,

Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,

Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,

Whose white investments figure innocence,

The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,

Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself

Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,

Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;

Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,

Your pens to lances and your tongue divine

To a trumpet and a point of war?


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.

Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,

And with our surfeiting and wanton hours

Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,

And we must bleed for it; of which disease

Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.

But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,

I take not on me here as a physician,

Nor do I as an enemy to peace

Troop in the throngs of military men;

But rather show awhile like fearful war,

To diet rank minds sick of happiness

And purge the obstructions which begin to stop

Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.

I have in equal balance justly weigh'd

What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,

And find our griefs heavier than our offences.

We see which way the stream of time doth run,

And are enforced from our most quiet there

By the rough torrent of occasion;

And have the summary of all our griefs,

When time shall serve, to show in articles;

Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,

And might by no suit gain our audience:

When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,

We are denied access unto his person

Even by those men that most have done us wrong.

The dangers of the days but newly gone,

Whose memory is written on the earth

With yet appearing blood, and the examples

Of every minute's instance, present now,

Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,

Not to break peace or any branch of it,

But to establish here a peace indeed,

Concurring both in name and quality.


WESTMORELAND

When ever yet was your appeal denied?

Wherein have you been galled by the king?

What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,

That you should seal this lawless bloody book

Of forged rebellion with a seal divine

And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

My brother general, the commonwealth,

To brother born an household cruelty,

I make my quarrel in particular.


WESTMORELAND

There is no need of any such redress;

Or if there were, it not belongs to you.


MOWBRAY

Why not to him in part, and to us all

That feel the bruises of the days before,

And suffer the condition of these times

To lay a heavy and unequal hand

Upon our honours?


WESTMORELAND

                  O, my good Lord Mowbray,

Construe the times to their necessities,

And you shall say indeed, it is the time,

And not the king, that doth you injuries.

Yet for your part, it not appears to me

Either from the king or in the present time

That you should have an inch of any ground

To build a grief on: were you not restored

To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,

Your noble and right well remember'd father's?


MOWBRAY

What thing, in honour, had my father lost,

That need to be revived and breathed in me?

The king that loved him, as the state stood then,

Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:

And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,

Being mounted and both roused in their seats,

Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,

Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,

Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel

And the loud trumpet blowing them together,

Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd

My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,

O when the king did throw his warder down,

His own life hung upon the staff he threw;

Then threw he down himself and all their lives

That by indictment and by dint of sword

Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.


WESTMORELAND

You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.

The Earl of Hereford was reputed then

In England the most valiant gentlemen:

Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?

But if your father had been victor there,

He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:

For all the country in a general voice

Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love

Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on

And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.

But this is mere digression from my purpose.

Here come I from our princely general

To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace

That he will give you audience; and wherein

It shall appear that your demands are just,

You shall enjoy them, every thing set off

That might so much as think you enemies.


MOWBRAY

But he hath forced us to compel this offer;

And it proceeds from policy, not love.


WESTMORELAND

Mowbray, you overween to take it so;

This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:

For, lo! within a ken our army lies,

Upon mine honour, all too confident

To give admittance to a thought of fear.

Our battle is more full of names than yours,

Our men more perfect in the use of arms,

Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;

Then reason will our heart should be as good

Say you not then our offer is compell'd.


MOWBRAY

Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.


WESTMORELAND

That argues but the shame of your offence:

A rotten case abides no handling.


HASTINGS

Hath the Prince John a full commission,

In very ample virtue of his father,

To hear and absolutely to determine

Of what conditions we shall stand upon?


WESTMORELAND

That is intended in the general's name:

I muse you make so slight a question.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,

For this contains our general grievances:

Each several article herein redress'd,

All members of our cause, both here and hence,

That are insinew'd to this action,

Acquitted by a true substantial form

And present execution of our wills

To us and to our purposes confined,

We come within our awful banks again

And knit our powers to the arm of peace.


WESTMORELAND

This will I show the general. Please you, lords,

In sight of both our battles we may meet;

And either end in peace, which God so frame!

Or to the place of difference call the swords

Which must decide it.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

My lord, we will do so.


Exit WESTMORELAND


MOWBRAY

There is a thing within my bosom tells me

That no conditions of our peace can stand.


HASTINGS

Fear you not that: if we can make our peace

Upon such large terms and so absolute

As our conditions shall consist upon,

Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.


MOWBRAY

Yea, but our valuation shall be such

That every slight and false-derived cause,

Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason

Shall to the king taste of this action;

That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,

We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind

That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff

And good from bad find no partition.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary

Of dainty and such picking grievances:

For he hath found to end one doubt by death

Revives two greater in the heirs of life,

And therefore will he wipe his tables clean

And keep no tell-tale to his memory

That may repeat and history his loss

To new remembrance; for full well he knows

He cannot so precisely weed this land

As his misdoubts present occasion:

His foes are so enrooted with his friends

That, plucking to unfix an enemy,

He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:

So that this land, like an offensive wife

That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,

As he is striking, holds his infant up

And hangs resolved correction in the arm

That was uprear'd to execution.


HASTINGS

Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods

On late offenders, that he now doth lack

The very instruments of chastisement:

So that his power, like to a fangless lion,

May offer, but not hold.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

'Tis very true:

And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,

If we do now make our atonement well,

Our peace will, like a broken limb united,

Grow stronger for the breaking.


MOWBRAY

Be it so.

Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.


Re-enter WESTMORELAND


WESTMORELAND

The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship

To meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.


MOWBRAY

Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.


Exeunt

SCENE II. Another part of the forest.

Enter, from one side, MOWBRAY, attended; afterwards  the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, HASTINGS, and others: from  the other side, Prince John of LANCASTER, and WESTMORELAND; Officers, and others with them

LANCASTER

You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:

Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;

And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.

My Lord of York, it better show'd with you

When that your flock, assembled by the bell,

Encircled you to hear with reverence

Your exposition on the holy text

Than now to see you here an iron man,

Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,

Turning the word to sword and life to death.

That man that sits within a monarch's heart,

And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,

Would he abuse the countenance of the king,

Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch

In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,

It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken

How deep you were within the books of God?

To us the speaker in his parliament;

To us the imagined voice of God himself;

The very opener and intelligencer

Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven

And our dull workings. O, who shall believe

But you misuse the reverence of your place,

Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,

As a false favourite doth his prince's name,

In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,

Under the counterfeited zeal of God,

The subjects of his substitute, my father,

And both against the peace of heaven and him

Have here up-swarm'd them.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Good my Lord of Lancaster,

I am not here against your father's peace;

But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,

The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,

Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,

To hold our safety up. I sent your grace

The parcels and particulars of our grief,

The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,

Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;

Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep

With grant of our most just and right desires,

And true obedience, of this madness cured,

Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.


MOWBRAY

If not, we ready are to try our fortunes

To the last man.


HASTINGS

                  And though we here fall down,

We have supplies to second our attempt:

If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;

And so success of mischief shall be born

And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up

Whiles England shall have generation.


LANCASTER

You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,

To sound the bottom of the after-times.


WESTMORELAND

Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly

How far forth you do like their articles.


LANCASTER

I like them all, and do allow them well,

And swear here, by the honour of my blood,

My father's purposes have been mistook,

And some about him have too lavishly

Wrested his meaning and authority.

My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;

Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,

Discharge your powers unto their several counties,

As we will ours: and here between the armies

Let's drink together friendly and embrace,

That all their eyes may bear those tokens home

Of our restored love and amity.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

I take your princely word for these redresses.


LANCASTER

I give it you, and will maintain my word:

And thereupon I drink unto your grace.


HASTINGS

Go, captain, and deliver to the army

This news of peace: let them have pay, and part:

I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.


Exit Officer


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.


WESTMORELAND

I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains

I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,

You would drink freely: but my love to ye

Shall show itself more openly hereafter.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

I do not doubt you.


WESTMORELAND

I am glad of it.

Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.


MOWBRAY

You wish me health in very happy season;

For I am, on the sudden, something ill.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Against ill chances men are ever merry;

But heaviness foreruns the good event.


WESTMORELAND

Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow

Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes

to-morrow.'


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.


MOWBRAY

So much the worse, if your own rule be true.


Shouts within


LANCASTER

The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!


MOWBRAY

This had been cheerful after victory.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

A peace is of the nature of a conquest;

For then both parties nobly are subdued,

And neither party loser.


LANCASTER

Go, my lord,

And let our army be discharged too.


Exit WESTMORELAND

And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains

March, by us, that we may peruse the men

We should have coped withal.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Go, good Lord Hastings,

And, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.


Exit HASTINGS


LANCASTER

I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.


Re-enter WESTMORELAND

Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?


WESTMORELAND

The leaders, having charge from you to stand,

Will not go off until they hear you speak.


LANCASTER

They know their duties.


Re-enter HASTINGS


HASTINGS

My lord, our army is dispersed already;

Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses

East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,

Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.


WESTMORELAND

Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which

I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:

And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,

Of capitol treason I attach you both.


MOWBRAY

Is this proceeding just and honourable?


WESTMORELAND

Is your assembly so?


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Will you thus break your faith?


LANCASTER

I pawn'd thee none:

I promised you redress of these same grievances

Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,

I will perform with a most Christian care.

But for you, rebels, look to taste the due

Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.

Most shallowly did you these arms commence,

Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.

Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:

God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.

Some guard these traitors to the block of death,

Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.


Exeunt

SCENE III. Another part of the forest.

Alarum. Excursions. Enter FALSTAFF and COLEVILE, meeting

FALSTAFF

What's your name, sir? of what condition are you,

and of what place, I pray?


COLEVILE

I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the dale.


FALSTAFF

Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your

degree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall be

still your name, a traitor your degree, and the

dungeon your place, a place deep enough; so shall

you be still Colevile of the dale.


COLEVILE

Are not you Sir John Falstaff?


FALSTAFF

As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye

yield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I do

sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they

weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and

trembling, and do observance to my mercy.


COLEVILE

I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that

thought yield me.


FALSTAFF

I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of

mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other

word but my name. An I had but a belly of any

indifference, I were simply the most active fellow

in Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.

Here comes our general.


Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, BLUNT, and others


LANCASTER

The heat is past; follow no further now:

Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.


Exit WESTMORELAND

Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?

When every thing is ended, then you come:

These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,

One time or other break some gallows' back.


FALSTAFF

I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I

never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward

of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a

bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the

expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with

the very extremest inch of possibility; I have

foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,

travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and

immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the

dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.

But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I

may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,

'I came, saw, and overcame.'


LANCASTER

It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.


FALSTAFF

I know not: here he is, and here I yield him: and

I beseech your grace, let it be booked with the

rest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will

have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own

picture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:

to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not

all show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the

clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full

moon doth the cinders of the element, which show

like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of

the noble: therefore let me have right, and let

desert mount.


LANCASTER

Thine's too heavy to mount.


FALSTAFF

Let it shine, then.


LANCASTER

Thine's too thick to shine.


FALSTAFF

Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me

good, and call it what you will.


LANCASTER

Is thy name Colevile?


COLEVILE

It is, my lord.


LANCASTER

A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.


FALSTAFF

And a famous true subject took him.


COLEVILE

I am, my lord, but as my betters are

That led me hither: had they been ruled by me,

You should have won them dearer than you have.


FALSTAFF

I know not how they sold themselves: but thou, like

a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I

thank thee for thee.


Re-enter WESTMORELAND


LANCASTER

Now, have you left pursuit?


WESTMORELAND

Retreat is made and execution stay'd.


LANCASTER

Send Colevile with his confederates

To York, to present execution:

Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.


Exeunt BLUNT and others with COLEVILE

And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:

I hear the king my father is sore sick:

Our news shall go before us to his majesty,

Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,

And we with sober speed will follow you.


FALSTAFF

My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go

Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,

Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.


LANCASTER

Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,

Shall better speak of you than you deserve.


Exeunt all but Falstaff


FALSTAFF

I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than

your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-

blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make

him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.

There's never none of these demure boys come to any

proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,

and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a

kind of male green-sickness; and then when they

marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools

and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for

inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold

operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;

dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy

vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,

quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and

delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the

voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes

excellent wit. The second property of your

excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;

which, before cold and settled, left the liver

white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity

and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes

it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:

it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives

warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,

man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and

inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,

the heart, who, great and puffed up with this

retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour

comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is

nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and

learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till

sack commences it and sets it in act and use.

Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for

the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his

father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,

manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent

endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile

sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If

I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I

would teach them should be, to forswear thin

potations and to addict themselves to sack.


Enter BARDOLPH

How now Bardolph?


BARDOLPH

The army is discharged all and gone.


FALSTAFF

Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and

there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire:

I have him already tempering between my finger and

my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him. Come away.


Exeunt

SCENE IV. Westminster. The Jerusalem Chamber.

Enter KING HENRY IV, the Princes Thomas of CLARENCE and Humphrey of GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others

KING HENRY IV

Now, lords, if God doth give successful end

To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,

We will our youth lead on to higher fields

And draw no swords but what are sanctified.

Our navy is address'd, our power collected,

Our substitutes in absence well invested,

And every thing lies level to our wish:

Only, we want a little personal strength;

And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,

Come underneath the yoke of government.


WARWICK

Both which we doubt not but your majesty

Shall soon enjoy.


KING HENRY IV

                  Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,

Where is the prince your brother?


GLOUCESTER

I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.


KING HENRY IV

And how accompanied?


GLOUCESTER

I do not know, my lord.


KING HENRY IV

Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?


GLOUCESTER

No, my good lord; he is in presence here.


CLARENCE

What would my lord and father?


KING HENRY IV

Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.

How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?

He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;

Thou hast a better place in his affection

Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,

And noble offices thou mayst effect

Of mediation, after I am dead,

Between his greatness and thy other brethren:

Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,

Nor lose the good advantage of his grace

By seeming cold or careless of his will;

For he is gracious, if he be observed:

He hath a tear for pity and a hand

Open as day for melting charity:

Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,

As humorous as winter and as sudden

As flaws congealed in the spring of day.

His temper, therefore, must be well observed:

Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,

When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;

But, being moody, give him line and scope,

Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,

Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,

And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,

A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,

That the united vessel of their blood,

Mingled with venom of suggestion--

As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--

Shall never leak, though it do work as strong

As aconitum or rash gunpowder.


CLARENCE

I shall observe him with all care and love.


KING HENRY IV

Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?


CLARENCE

He is not there to-day; he dines in London.


KING HENRY IV

And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?


CLARENCE

With Poins, and other his continual followers.


KING HENRY IV

Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;

And he, the noble image of my youth,

Is overspread with them: therefore my grief

Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:

The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape

In forms imaginary the unguided days

And rotten times that you shall look upon

When I am sleeping with my ancestors.

For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,

When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,

When means and lavish manners meet together,

O, with what wings shall his affections fly

Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!


WARWICK

My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:

The prince but studies his companions

Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,

'Tis needful that the most immodest word

Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,

Your highness knows, comes to no further use

But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,

The prince will in the perfectness of time

Cast off his followers; and their memory

Shall as a pattern or a measure live,

By which his grace must mete the lives of others,

Turning past evils to advantages.


KING HENRY IV

'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb

In the dead carrion.


Enter WESTMORELAND

Who's here? Westmoreland?


WESTMORELAND

Health to my sovereign, and new happiness

Added to that that I am to deliver!

Prince John your son doth kiss your grace's hand:

Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings and all

Are brought to the correction of your law;

There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd

But peace puts forth her olive every where.

The manner how this action hath been borne

Here at more leisure may your highness read,

With every course in his particular.


KING HENRY IV

O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,

Which ever in the haunch of winter sings

The lifting up of day.


Enter HARCOURT

Look, here's more news.


HARCOURT

From enemies heaven keep your majesty;

And, when they stand against you, may they fall

As those that I am come to tell you of!

The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,

With a great power of English and of Scots

Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown:

The manner and true order of the fight

This packet, please it you, contains at large.


KING HENRY IV

And wherefore should these good news make me sick?

Will fortune never come with both hands full,

But write her fair words still in foulest letters?

She either gives a stomach and no food;

Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast

And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,

That have abundance and enjoy it not.

I should rejoice now at this happy news;

And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:

O me! come near me; now I am much ill.


GLOUCESTER

Comfort, your majesty!


CLARENCE

O my royal father!


WESTMORELAND

My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.


WARWICK

Be patient, princes; you do know, these fits

Are with his highness very ordinary.

Stand from him. Give him air; he'll straight be well.


CLARENCE

No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:

The incessant care and labour of his mind

Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in

So thin that life looks through and will break out.


GLOUCESTER

The people fear me; for they do observe

Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:

The seasons change their manners, as the year

Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.


CLARENCE

The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;

And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,

Say it did so a little time before

That our great-grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died.


WARWICK

Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers.


GLOUCESTER

This apoplexy will certain be his end.


KING HENRY IV

I pray you, take me up, and bear me hence

Into some other chamber: softly, pray.

SCENE V. Another chamber.

KING HENRY IV lying on a bed: CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others in attendance

KING HENRY IV

Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;

Unless some dull and favourable hand

Will whisper music to my weary spirit.


WARWICK

Call for the music in the other room.


KING HENRY IV

Set me the crown upon my pillow here.


CLARENCE

His eye is hollow, and he changes much.


WARWICK

Less noise, less noise!


Enter PRINCE HENRY


PRINCE HENRY

Who saw the Duke of Clarence?


CLARENCE

I am here, brother, full of heaviness.


PRINCE HENRY

How now! rain within doors, and none abroad!

How doth the king?


GLOUCESTER

Exceeding ill.


PRINCE HENRY

                  Heard he the good news yet?

Tell it him.


GLOUCESTER

He alter'd much upon the hearing it.


PRINCE HENRY

If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.


WARWICK

Not so much noise, my lords: sweet prince,

speak low;

The king your father is disposed to sleep.


CLARENCE

Let us withdraw into the other room.


WARWICK

Will't please your grace to go along with us?


PRINCE HENRY

No; I will sit and watch here by the king.


Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY

Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,

Being so troublesome a bedfellow?

O polish'd perturbation! golden care!

That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide

To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!

Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet

As he whose brow with homely biggen bound

Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!

When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit

Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,

That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath

There lies a downy feather which stirs not:

Did he suspire, that light and weightless down

Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!

This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep

That from this golden rigol hath divorced

So many English kings. Thy due from me

Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,

Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,

Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:

My due from thee is this imperial crown,

Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,

Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,

Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strength

Into one giant arm, it shall not force

This lineal honour from me: this from thee

Will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.


Exit


KING HENRY IV

Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!


Re-enter WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest


CLARENCE

Doth the king call?


WARWICK

What would your majesty? How fares your grace?


KING HENRY IV

Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?


CLARENCE

We left the prince my brother here, my liege,

Who undertook to sit and watch by you.


KING HENRY IV

The Prince of Wales! Where is he? let me see him:

He is not here.


WARWICK

This door is open; he is gone this way.


GLOUCESTER

He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.


KING HENRY IV

Where is the crown? who took it from my pillow?


WARWICK

When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.


KING HENRY IV

The prince hath ta'en it hence: go, seek him out.

Is he so hasty that he doth suppose

My sleep my death?

Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither.


Exit WARWICK

This part of his conjoins with my disease,

And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!

How quickly nature falls into revolt

When gold becomes her object!

For this the foolish over-careful fathers

Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,

Their bones with industry;

For this they have engrossed and piled up

The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold;

For this they have been thoughtful to invest

Their sons with arts and martial exercises:

When, like the bee, culling from every flower

The virtuous sweets,

Our thighs pack'd with wax, our mouths with honey,

We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,

Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste

Yield his engrossments to the ending father.


Re-enter WARWICK

Now, where is he that will not stay so long

Till his friend sickness hath determined me?


WARWICK

My lord, I found the prince in the next room,

Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,

With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow

That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,

Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife

With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.


KING HENRY IV

But wherefore did he take away the crown?


Re-enter PRINCE HENRY

Lo, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.

Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.


Exeunt WARWICK and the rest


PRINCE HENRY

I never thought to hear you speak again.


KING HENRY IV

Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:

I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.

Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair

That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours

Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!

Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.

Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity

Is held from falling with so weak a wind

That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.

Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours

Were thine without offence; and at my death

Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:

Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,

And thou wilt have me die assured of it.

Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,

Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,

To stab at half an hour of my life.

What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?

Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,

And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear

That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.

Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse

Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:

Only compound me with forgotten dust

Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.

Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;

For now a time is come to mock at form:

Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!

Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!

And to the English court assemble now,

From every region, apes of idleness!

Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:

Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,

Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit

The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?

Be happy, he will trouble you no more;

England shall double gild his treble guilt,

England shall give him office, honour, might;

For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks

The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog

Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.

O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!

When that my care could not withhold thy riots,

What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?

O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,

Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!


PRINCE HENRY

O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,

The moist impediments unto my speech,

I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke

Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard

The course of it so far. There is your crown;

And He that wears the crown immortally

Long guard it yours! If I affect it more

Than as your honour and as your renown,

Let me no more from this obedience rise,

Which my most inward true and duteous spirit

Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.

God witness with me, when I here came in,

And found no course of breath within your majesty,

How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,

O, let me in my present wildness die

And never live to show the incredulous world

The noble change that I have purposed!

Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,

And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,

I spake unto this crown as having sense,

And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending

Hath fed upon the body of my father;

Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:

Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,

Preserving life in medicine potable;

But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,

Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,

Accusing it, I put it on my head,

To try with it, as with an enemy

That had before my face murder'd my father,

The quarrel of a true inheritor.

But if it did infect my blood with joy,

Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;

If any rebel or vain spirit of mine

Did with the least affection of a welcome

Give entertainment to the might of it,

Let God for ever keep it from my head

And make me as the poorest vassal is

That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!


KING HENRY IV

O my son,

God put it in thy mind to take it hence,

That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,

Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!

Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;

And hear, I think, the very latest counsel

That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,

By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways

I met this crown; and I myself know well

How troublesome it sat upon my head.

To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,

Better opinion, better confirmation;

For all the soil of the achievement goes

With me into the earth. It seem'd in me

But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,

And I had many living to upbraid

My gain of it by their assistances;

Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,

Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears

Thou see'st with peril I have answered;

For all my reign hath been but as a scene

Acting that argument: and now my death

Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,

Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;

So thou the garland wear'st successively.

Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,

Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;

And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,

Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;

By whose fell working I was first advanced

And by whose power I well might lodge a fear

To be again displaced: which to avoid,

I cut them off; and had a purpose now

To lead out many to the Holy Land,

Lest rest and lying still might make them look

Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,

Be it thy course to busy giddy minds

With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,

May waste the memory of the former days.

More would I, but my lungs are wasted so

That strength of speech is utterly denied me.

How I came by the crown, O God forgive;

And grant it may with thee in true peace live!


PRINCE HENRY

My gracious liege,

You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;

Then plain and right must my possession be:

Which I with more than with a common pain

'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.


Enter Lord John of LANCASTER


KING HENRY IV

Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.


LANCASTER

Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!


KING HENRY IV

Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;

But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown

From this bare wither'd trunk: upon thy sight

My worldly business makes a period.

Where is my Lord of Warwick?


PRINCE HENRY

My Lord of Warwick!


Enter WARWICK, and others


KING HENRY IV

Doth any name particular belong

Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?


WARWICK

'Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord.


KING HENRY IV

Laud be to God! even there my life must end.

It hath been prophesied to me many years,

I should not die but in Jerusalem;

Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land:

But bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie;

In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.


Exeunt


ACT V
SCENE I. Gloucestershire. SHALLOW'S house.

Enter SHALLOW, FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, and Page

SHALLOW

By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.

What, Davy, I say!


FALSTAFF

You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.


SHALLOW

I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused;

excuses shall not be admitted; there is no excuse

shall serve; you shall not be excused. Why, Davy!


Enter DAVY


DAVY

Here, sir.


SHALLOW

Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy; let me

see, Davy; let me see: yea, marry, William cook,

bid him come hither. Sir John, you shall not be excused.


DAVY

Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served:

and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat?


SHALLOW

With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook: are

there no young pigeons?


DAVY

Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing

and plough-irons.


SHALLOW

Let it be cast and paid. Sir John, you shall not be excused.


DAVY

Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must need be

had: and, sir, do you mean to stop any of William's

wages, about the sack he lost the other day at

Hinckley fair?


SHALLOW

A' shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple

of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any

pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.


DAVY

Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?


SHALLOW

Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the

court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men

well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.


DAVY

No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they

have marvellous foul linen.


SHALLOW

Well conceited, Davy: about thy business, Davy.


DAVY

I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of

Woncot against Clement Perkes of the hill.


SHALLOW

There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor:

that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.


DAVY

I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but

yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some

countenance at his friend's request. An honest

man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave

is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,

this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in

a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I

have but a very little credit with your worship. The

knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I

beseech your worship, let him be countenanced.


SHALLOW

Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy.


Exit DAVY

Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off

with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.


BARDOLPH

I am glad to see your worship.


SHALLOW

I thank thee with all my heart, kind

Master Bardolph: and welcome, my tall fellow.


To the Page

Come, Sir John.


FALSTAFF

I'll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.


Exit SHALLOW

Bardolph, look to our horses.


Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page

If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four

dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master

Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the

semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:

they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like

foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is

turned into a justice-like serving-man: their

spirits are so married in conjunction with the

participation of society that they flock together in

consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit

to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the

imputation of being near their master: if to his

men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man

could better command his servants. It is certain

that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is

caught, as men take diseases, one of another:

therefore let men take heed of their company. I

will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to

keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing

out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two

actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,

it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest

with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never

had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him

laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!


SHALLOW

[Within]  Sir John!


FALSTAFF

I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.


Exit

SCENE II. Westminster. The palace.

Enter WARWICK and the Lord Chief-Justice, meeting

WARWICK

How now, my lord chief-justice! whither away?

Lord Chief-Justice	How doth the king?


WARWICK

Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.

Lord Chief-Justice	I hope, not dead.


WARWICK

He's walk'd the way of nature;

And to our purposes he lives no more.

Lord Chief-Justice	I would his majesty had call'd me with him:

The service that I truly did his life

Hath left me open to all injuries.


WARWICK

Indeed I think the young king loves you not.

Lord Chief-Justice	I know he doth not, and do arm myself

To welcome the condition of the time,

Which cannot look more hideously upon me

Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.


Enter LANCASTER, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WESTMORELAND, and others


WARWICK

Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry:

O that the living Harry had the temper

Of him, the worst of these three gentlemen!

How many nobles then should hold their places

That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!

Lord Chief-Justice	O God, I fear all will be overturn'd!


LANCASTER

Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.


GLOUCESTER


CLARENCE

Good morrow, cousin.


LANCASTER

We meet like men that had forgot to speak.


WARWICK

We do remember; but our argument

Is all too heavy to admit much talk.


LANCASTER

Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.

Lord Chief-Justice	Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!


GLOUCESTER

O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;

And I dare swear you borrow not that face

Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your own.


LANCASTER

Though no man be assured what grace to find,

You stand in coldest expectation:

I am the sorrier; would 'twere otherwise.


CLARENCE

Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;

Which swims against your stream of quality.

Lord Chief-Justice	Sweet princes, what I did, I did in honour,

Led by the impartial conduct of my soul:

And never shall you see that I will beg

A ragged and forestall'd remission.

If truth and upright innocency fail me,

I'll to the king my master that is dead,

And tell him who hath sent me after him.


WARWICK

Here comes the prince.


Enter KING HENRY V, attended

Lord Chief-Justice	Good morrow; and God save your majesty!


KING HENRY V

This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,

Sits not so easy on me as you think.

Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:

This is the English, not the Turkish court;

Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,

But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,

For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:

Sorrow so royally in you appears

That I will deeply put the fashion on

And wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;

But entertain no more of it, good brothers,

Than a joint burden laid upon us all.

For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,

I'll be your father and your brother too;

Let me but bear your love, I 'll bear your cares:

Yet weep that Harry's dead; and so will I;

But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears

By number into hours of happiness.


Princes

We hope no other from your majesty.


KING HENRY V

You all look strangely on me: and you most;

You are, I think, assured I love you not.

Lord Chief-Justice	I am assured, if I be measured rightly,

Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.


KING HENRY V

No!

How might a prince of my great hopes forget

So great indignities you laid upon me?

What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison

The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?

May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?

Lord Chief-Justice	I then did use the person of your father;

The image of his power lay then in me:

And, in the administration of his law,

Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,

Your highness pleased to forget my place,

The majesty and power of law and justice,

The image of the king whom I presented,

And struck me in my very seat of judgment;

Whereon, as an offender to your father,

I gave bold way to my authority

And did commit you. If the deed were ill,

Be you contented, wearing now the garland,

To have a son set your decrees at nought,

To pluck down justice from your awful bench,

To trip the course of law and blunt the sword

That guards the peace and safety of your person;

Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image

And mock your workings in a second body.

Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;

Be now the father and propose a son,

Hear your own dignity so much profaned,

See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,

Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;

And then imagine me taking your part

And in your power soft silencing your son:

After this cold considerance, sentence me;

And, as you are a king, speak in your state

What I have done that misbecame my place,

My person, or my liege's sovereignty.


KING HENRY V

You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;

Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:

And I do wish your honours may increase,

Till you do live to see a son of mine

Offend you and obey you, as I did.

So shall I live to speak my father's words:

'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,

That dares do justice on my proper son;

And not less happy, having such a son,

That would deliver up his greatness so

Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:

For which, I do commit into your hand

The unstained sword that you have used to bear;

With this remembrance, that you use the same

With the like bold, just and impartial spirit

As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.

You shall be as a father to my youth:

My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,

And I will stoop and humble my intents

To your well-practised wise directions.

And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;

My father is gone wild into his grave,

For in his tomb lie my affections;

And with his spirit sadly I survive,

To mock the expectation of the world,

To frustrate prophecies and to raze out

Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down

After my seeming. The tide of blood in me

Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:

Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,

Where it shall mingle with the state of floods

And flow henceforth in formal majesty.

Now call we our high court of parliament:

And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,

That the great body of our state may go

In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;

That war, or peace, or both at once, may be

As things acquainted and familiar to us;

In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.

Our coronation done, we will accite,

As I before remember'd, all our state:

And, God consigning to my good intents,

No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,

God shorten Harry's happy life one day!


Exeunt

SCENE III. Gloucestershire. SHALLOW'S orchard.

Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, SILENCE, DAVY, BARDOLPH, and the Page

SHALLOW

Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour,

we will eat a last year's pippin of my own graffing,

with a dish of caraways, and so forth: come,

cousin Silence: and then to bed.


FALSTAFF

'Fore God, you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich.


SHALLOW

Barren, barren, barren; beggars all, beggars all,

Sir John: marry, good air. Spread, Davy; spread,

Davy; well said, Davy.


FALSTAFF

This Davy serves you for good uses; he is your

serving-man and your husband.


SHALLOW

A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet,

Sir John: by the mass, I have drunk too much sack

at supper: a good varlet. Now sit down, now sit

down: come, cousin.


SILENCE

Ah, sirrah! quoth-a, we shall

Do nothing but eat, and make good cheer,


Singing

And praise God for the merry year;

When flesh is cheap and females dear,

And lusty lads roam here and there

So merrily,

And ever among so merrily.


FALSTAFF

There's a merry heart! Good Master Silence, I'll

give you a health for that anon.


SHALLOW

Give Master Bardolph some wine, Davy.


DAVY

Sweet sir, sit; I'll be with you anon. most sweet

sir, sit. Master page, good master page, sit.

Proface! What you want in meat, we'll have in drink:

but you must bear; the heart's all.


Exit


SHALLOW

Be merry, Master Bardolph; and, my little soldier

there, be merry.


SILENCE

Be merry, be merry, my wife has all;


Singing

For women are shrews, both short and tall:

'Tis merry in hall when beards wag all,

And welcome merry Shrove-tide.

Be merry, be merry.


FALSTAFF

I did not think Master Silence had been a man of

this mettle.


SILENCE

Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere now.


Re-enter DAVY


DAVY

There's a dish of leather-coats for you.


To BARDOLPH


SHALLOW

Davy!


DAVY

Your worship! I'll be with you straight.


To BARDOLPH

A cup of wine, sir?


SILENCE

A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,


Singing

And drink unto the leman mine;

And a merry heart lives long-a.


FALSTAFF

Well said, Master Silence.


SILENCE

An we shall be merry, now comes in the sweet o' the night.


FALSTAFF

Health and long life to you, Master Silence.


SILENCE

Fill the cup, and let it come;


Singing

I'll pledge you a mile to the bottom.


SHALLOW

Honest Bardolph, welcome: if thou wantest any

thing, and wilt not call, beshrew thy heart.

Welcome, my little tiny thief.


To the Page

And welcome indeed too. I'll drink to Master

Bardolph, and to all the cavaleros about London.


DAVY

I hove to see London once ere I die.


BARDOLPH

An I might see you there, Davy,--


SHALLOW

By the mass, you'll crack a quart together, ha!

Will you not, Master Bardolph?


BARDOLPH

Yea, sir, in a pottle-pot.


SHALLOW

By God's liggens, I thank thee: the knave will

stick by thee, I can assure thee that. A' will not

out; he is true bred.


BARDOLPH

And I'll stick by him, sir.


SHALLOW

Why, there spoke a king. Lack nothing: be merry.


Knocking within

Look who's at door there, ho! who knocks?


Exit DAVY


FALSTAFF

Why, now you have done me right.


To SILENCE, seeing him take off a bumper


SILENCE

[Singing]

Do me right,

And dub me knight: Samingo.

Is't not so?


FALSTAFF

'Tis so.


SILENCE

Is't so? Why then, say an old man can do somewhat.


Re-enter DAVY


DAVY

An't please your worship, there's one Pistol come

from the court with news.


FALSTAFF

From the court! let him come in.


Enter PISTOL

How now, Pistol!


PISTOL

Sir John, God save you!


FALSTAFF

What wind blew you hither, Pistol?


PISTOL

Not the ill wind which blows no man to good. Sweet

knight, thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.


SILENCE

By'r lady, I think a' be, but goodman Puff of Barson.


PISTOL

Puff!

Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!

Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,

And helter-skelter have I rode to thee,

And tidings do I bring and lucky joys

And golden times and happy news of price.


FALSTAFF

I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this world.


PISTOL

A foutre for the world and worldlings base!

I speak of Africa and golden joys.


FALSTAFF

O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news?

Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.


SILENCE

And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.


Singing


PISTOL

Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons?

And shall good news be baffled?

Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.


SILENCE

Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.


PISTOL

Why then, lament therefore.


SHALLOW

Give me pardon, sir: if, sir, you come with news

from the court, I take it there's but two ways,

either to utter them, or to conceal them. I am,

sir, under the king, in some authority.


PISTOL

Under which king, Besonian? speak, or die.


SHALLOW

Under King Harry.


PISTOL

                  Harry the Fourth? or Fifth?


SHALLOW

Harry the Fourth.


PISTOL

A foutre for thine office!

Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is king;

Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth:

When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like

The bragging Spaniard.


FALSTAFF

What, is the old king dead?


PISTOL

As nail in door: the things I speak are just.


FALSTAFF

Away, Bardolph! saddle my horse. Master Robert

Shallow, choose what office thou wilt in the land,

'tis thine. Pistol, I will double-charge thee with dignities.


BARDOLPH

O joyful day!

I would not take a knighthood for my fortune.


PISTOL

What! I do bring good news.


FALSTAFF

Carry Master Silence to bed. Master Shallow, my

Lord Shallow,--be what thou wilt; I am fortune's

steward--get on thy boots: we'll ride all night.

O sweet Pistol! Away, Bardolph!


Exit BARDOLPH

Come, Pistol, utter more to me; and withal devise

something to do thyself good. Boot, boot, Master

Shallow: I know the young king is sick for me. Let

us take any man's horses; the laws of England are at

my commandment. Blessed are they that have been my

friends; and woe to my lord chief-justice!


PISTOL

Let vultures vile seize on his lungs also!

'Where is the life that late I led?' say they:

Why, here it is; welcome these pleasant days!


Exeunt

SCENE IV. London. A street.

Enter Beadles, dragging in HOSTESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET

MISTRESS QUICKLY

No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I might

die, that I might have thee hanged: thou hast

drawn my shoulder out of joint.


First Beadle

The constables have delivered her over to me; and

she shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant

her: there hath been a man or two lately killed about her.


DOLL TEARSHEET

Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I 'll tell

thee what, thou damned tripe-visaged rascal, an

the child I now go with do miscarry, thou wert

better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou

paper-faced villain.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

O the Lord, that Sir John were come! he would make

this a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the

fruit of her womb miscarry!


First Beadle

If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again;

you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go

with me; for the man is dead that you and Pistol

beat amongst you.


DOLL TEARSHEET

I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I

will have you as soundly swinged for this,--you

blue-bottle rogue, you filthy famished correctioner,

if you be not swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles.


First Beadle

Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

O God, that right should thus overcome might!

Well, of sufferance comes ease.


DOLL TEARSHEET

Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Ay, come, you starved blood-hound.


DOLL TEARSHEET

Goodman death, goodman bones!


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Thou atomy, thou!


DOLL TEARSHEET

Come, you thin thing; come you rascal.


First Beadle

Very well.


Exeunt

SCENE V. A public place near Westminster Abbey.

Enter two Grooms, strewing rushes

First Groom

More rushes, more rushes.


Second Groom

The trumpets have sounded twice.


First Groom

'Twill be two o'clock ere they come from the

coronation: dispatch, dispatch.


Exeunt


Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and Page


FALSTAFF

Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will

make the king do you grace: I will leer upon him as

a' comes by; and do but mark the countenance that he

will give me.


PISTOL

God bless thy lungs, good knight.


FALSTAFF

Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. O, if I had had

time to have made new liveries, I would have

bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But

'tis no matter; this poor show doth better: this

doth infer the zeal I had to see him.


SHALLOW

It doth so.


FALSTAFF

It shows my earnestness of affection,--


SHALLOW

It doth so.


FALSTAFF

My devotion,--


SHALLOW

It doth, it doth, it doth.


FALSTAFF

As it were, to ride day and night; and not to

deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience

to shift me,--


SHALLOW

It is best, certain.


FALSTAFF

But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with

desire to see him; thinking of nothing else,

putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there

were nothing else to be done but to see him.


PISTOL

'Tis 'semper idem,' for 'obsque hoc nihil est:'

'tis all in every part.


SHALLOW

'Tis so, indeed.


PISTOL

My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,

And make thee rage.

Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,

Is in base durance and contagious prison;

Haled thither

By most mechanical and dirty hand:

Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell

Alecto's snake,

For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.


FALSTAFF

I will deliver her.


Shouts within, and the trumpets sound


PISTOL

There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.


Enter KING HENRY V and his train, the Lord Chief- Justice among them


FALSTAFF

God save thy grace, King Hal! my royal Hal!


PISTOL

The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!


FALSTAFF

God save thee, my sweet boy!


KING HENRY IV

My lord chief-justice, speak to that vain man.

Lord Chief-Justice	Have you your wits? know you what 'tis to speak?


FALSTAFF

My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!


KING HENRY IV

I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;

How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!

I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,

So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;

But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.

Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;

Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape

For thee thrice wider than for other men.

Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:

Presume not that I am the thing I was;

For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,

That I have turn'd away my former self;

So will I those that kept me company.

When thou dost hear I am as I have been,

Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,

The tutor and the feeder of my riots:

Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,

As I have done the rest of my misleaders,

Not to come near our person by ten mile.

For competence of life I will allow you,

That lack of means enforce you not to evil:

And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,

We will, according to your strengths and qualities,

Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,

To see perform'd the tenor of our word. Set on.


Exeunt KING HENRY V,  & c


FALSTAFF

Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.


SHALLOW

Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me

have home with me.


FALSTAFF

That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you

grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to

him: look you, he must seem thus to the world:

fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet

that shall make you great.


SHALLOW

I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give

me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I

beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred

of my thousand.


FALSTAFF

Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that you

heard was but a colour.


SHALLOW

A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.


FALSTAFF

Fear no colours: go  with me to dinner: come,

Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph: I shall be sent

for soon at night.


Re-enter Prince John of LANCASTER, the Lord Chief-Justice; Officers with them

Lord Chief-Justice	Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet:

Take all his company along with him.


FALSTAFF

My lord, my lord,--

Lord Chief-Justice	I cannot now speak: I will hear you soon.

Take them away.


PISTOL

Si fortune me tormenta, spero contenta.


Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the Lord Chief-Justice


LANCASTER

I like this fair proceeding of the king's:

He hath intent his wonted followers

Shall all be very well provided for;

But all are banish'd till their conversations

Appear more wise and modest to the world.

Lord Chief-Justice	And so they are.


LANCASTER

The king hath call'd his parliament, my lord.

Lord Chief-Justice	He hath.


LANCASTER

I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,

We bear our civil swords and native fire

As far as France: I beard a bird so sing,

Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.

Come, will you hence?


Exeunt

EPILOGUE


Spoken by a Dancer

First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.

My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;

and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look

for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have

to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I

should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.

But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it

known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here

in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your

patience for it and to promise you a better. I

meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an

ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and

you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you

I would be and here I commit my body to your

mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,

as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.

If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will

you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but

light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a

good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,

and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have

forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the

gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which

was never seen before in such an assembly.

One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too

much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will

continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make

you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for

any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,

unless already a' be killed with your hard

opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is

not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are

too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down

before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.

up, my lord.


KENT

Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much

That would upon the rack of this tough world

Stretch him out longer.


EDGAR

He is gone, indeed.


KENT

The wonder is, he hath endured so long:

He but usurp'd his life.


ALBANY

Bear them from hence. Our present business

Is general woe.


To KENT and EDGAR

Friends of my soul, you twain

Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.


KENT

I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;

My master calls me, I must not say no.


ALBANY

The weight of this sad time we must obey;

Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.

The oldest hath borne most: we that are young

Shall never see so much, nor live so long.


Exeunt, with a dead march
